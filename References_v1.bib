	Abstract = {Current mechanistic knowledge of protein interactions driving blood coagulation has come largely from experiments with simple synthetic systems, which only partially represent the molecular composition of human blood plasma. Here, we investigate the ability of the suggested molecular mechanisms to account for fibrin generation and degradation kinetics in diverse, physiologically relevant in vitro systems. We represented the protein interaction network responsible for thrombin generation, fibrin formation, and fibrinolysis as a computational kinetic model and benchmarked it against published and newly generated data reflecting diverse experimental conditions. We then applied the model to investigate the ability of fibrinogen and a recently proposed prothrombin complex concentrate composition, PCC-AT (a combination of the clotting factors II, IX, X, and antithrombin), to restore normal thrombin and fibrin generation in diluted plasma. The kinetic model captured essential features of empirically detected effects of prothrombin, fibrinogen, and thrombin-activatable fibrinolysis inhibitor titrations on fibrin formation and degradation kinetics. Moreover, the model qualitatively predicted the impact of tissue factor and tPA/tenecteplase level variations on the fibrin output. In the majority of considered cases, PCC-AT combined with fibrinogen accurately approximated both normal thrombin and fibrin generation in diluted plasma, which could not be accomplished by fibrinogen or PCC-AT acting alone. We conclude that a common network of protein interactions can account for key kinetic features characterizing fibrin accumulation and degradation in human blood plasma under diverse experimental conditions. Combined PCC-AT/fibrinogen supplementation is a promising strategy to reverse the deleterious effects of dilution-induced coagulopathy associated with traumatic bleeding.},

	Abstract = {Multiple models of human metabolism have been reconstructed, but each represents only a subset of our knowledge. Here we describe Recon 2, a community-driven, consensus 'metabolic reconstruction', which is the most comprehensive representation of human metabolism that is applicable to computational modeling. Compared with its predecessors, the reconstruction has improved topological and functional features, including ∼2× more reactions and ∼1.7× more unique metabolites. Using Recon 2 we predicted changes in metabolite biomarkers for 49 inborn errors of metabolism with 77% accuracy when compared to experimental data. Mapping metabolomic data and drug information onto Recon 2 demonstrates its potential for integrating and analyzing diverse data types. Using protein expression data, we automatically generated a compendium of 65 cell type-specific models, providing a basis for manual curation or investigation of cell-specific metabolic properties. Recon 2 will facilitate many future biomedical studies and is freely available at http://humanmetabolism.org/.},

@article{Bordbar:2011aa,
	Abstract = {BACKGROUND: Genome-scale metabolic reconstructions provide a biologically meaningful mechanistic basis for the genotype-phenotype relationship. The global human metabolic network, termed Recon 1, has recently been reconstructed allowing the systems analysis of human metabolic physiology and pathology. Utilizing high-throughput data, Recon 1 has recently been tailored to different cells and tissues, including the liver, kidney, brain, and alveolar macrophage. These models have shown utility in the study of systems medicine. However, no integrated analysis between human tissues has been done.
RESULTS: To describe tissue-specific functions, Recon 1 was tailored to describe metabolism in three human cells: adipocytes, hepatocytes, and myocytes. These cell-specific networks were manually curated and validated based on known cellular metabolic functions. To study intercellular interactions, a novel multi-tissue type modeling approach was developed to integrate the metabolic functions for the three cell types, and subsequently used to simulate known integrated metabolic cycles. In addition, the multi-tissue model was used to study diabetes: a pathology with systemic properties. High-throughput data was integrated with the network to determine differential metabolic activity between obese and type II obese gastric bypass patients in a whole-body context.
CONCLUSION: The multi-tissue type modeling approach presented provides a platform to study integrated metabolic states. As more cell and tissue-specific models are released, it is critical to develop a framework in which to study their interdependencies.},

@article{Allen:2003aa,
	Abstract = {Constraints-based models for microbial metabolism can currently be constructed on a genome-scale. These models do not account for RNA and protein synthesis. A scalable formalism to describe translation and transcription that can be integrated with the existing metabolic models is thus needed. Here, we developed such a formalism. The fundamental protein synthesis network described by this formalism was analysed via extreme pathway and flux balance analyses. The protein synthesis network exhibited one extreme pathway per messenger RNA synthesized and one extreme pathway per protein synthesized. The key parameters in this network included promoter strengths, messenger RNA half-lives, and the availability of nucleotide triphosphates, amino acids, RNA polymerase, and active ribosomes. Given these parameters, we were able to calculate a cell's material and energy expenditures for protein synthesis using a flux balance approach. The framework provided herein can subsequently be integrated with genome-scale metabolic models, providing a sequence-based accounting of the metabolic demands resulting from RNA and protein polymerization.},

	Abstract = {Mathematical models of biochemical networks are useful tools to understand and ultimately predict how cells utilize nutrients to produce valuable products. Hybrid cybernetic models in combination with elementary modes (HCM-EM) is a tool to model cellular metabolism. However, HCM-EM is limited to reduced metabolic networks because of the computational burden of calculating elementary modes. In this study, we developed the hybrid cybernetic modeling with flux balance analysis or HCM-FBA technique which uses flux balance solutions instead of elementary modes to dynamically model metabolism. We show HCM-FBA has comparable performance to HCM-EM for a proof of concept metabolic network and for a reduced anaerobic E. coli network. Next, HCM-FBA was applied to a larger metabolic network of aerobic E. coli metabolism which was infeasible for HCM-EM (29 FBA modes versus more than 153,000 elementary modes). Global sensitivity analysis further reduced the number of FBA modes required to describe the aerobic E. coli data, while maintaining model fit. Thus, HCM-FBA is a promising alternative to HCM-EM for large networks where the generation of elementary modes is infeasible.},

@article{Nayak:2010aa,
	Abstract = {Arsenic trioxide (ATO) synergistically promotes all trans retinoic acid (ATRA)-induced differentiation of PML-RARalpha negative HL-60 myeloblastic leukemia cells. In PML-RARalpha positive myeloid leukemia cells, ATO is known to cause degradation of PML-RARalpha with subsequent induced myeloid differentiation. We found that ATO by itself does not cause differentiation of the PML-RARalpha negative HL-60 cells, but enhances ATRA's capability to cause differentiation. ATO augmented ATRA-induced RAF/MEK/ERK axis signaling, expression of CD11b and p47(PHOX), and inducible oxidative metabolism. ATO enhanced ATRA-induced population growth retardation without evidence of apoptosis or enhanced G1/G0 growth arrest. Compared to ATRA-treated cells, the ATRA plus ATO-treated cells progressed more slowly through the cell cycle as detected by a slower rate of accumulation in G2/M following nocodazole treatment. Hoechst/PI staining showed that low-dose ATO did not induce apoptosis. In summary, our results indicate that ATO in conjunction with ATRA is of potential chemotherapeutic use in PML-RARalpha negative leukemias.},

@article{Jensen:2013aa,
	Abstract = {Retinoic acid is an embryonic morphogen and dietary factor that demonstrates chemotherapeutic efficacy in inducing maturation in leukemia cells. Using HL60 model human myeloid leukemia cells, where all-trans retinoic acid (RA) induces granulocytic differentiation, we developed two emergent RA-resistant HL60 cell lines which are characterized by loss of RA-inducible G1/G0 arrest, CD11b expression, inducible oxidative metabolism and p47(phox) expression. However, RA-treated RA-resistant HL60 continue to exhibit sustained MEK/ERK activation, and one of the two sequentially emergent resistant lines retains RA-inducible CD38 expression. Other signaling events that define the wild-type (WT) response are compromised, including c-Raf phosphorylation and increased expression of c-Cbl, Vav1, and the Src-family kinases (SFKs) Lyn and Fgr. As shown previously in WT HL60 cells, we found that the SFK inhibitor PP2 significantly increases G1/G0 cell cycle arrest, CD38 and CD11b expression, c-Raf phosphorylation and expression of the aforementioned regulators in RA-resistant HL60. The resistant cells were potentially incapable of developing inducible oxidative metabolism. These results motivate the concept that RA resistance can occur in steps, wherein growth arrest and other differentiation events may be recovered in both emergent lines. Investigating the mechanistic anomalies in resistant cell lines is of therapeutic significance and helps to mechanistically understand the response to retinoic acid's biological effects in WT HL60 cells.},

	Abstract = {Understanding individual variation is fundamental to personalized medicine. Yet interpreting complex phenotype data, such as multi-compartment metabolomic profiles, in the context of genotype data for an individual is complicated by interactions within and between cells and remains an unresolved challenge. Here, we constructed multi-omic, data-driven, personalized whole-cell kinetic models of erythrocyte metabolism for 24 healthy individuals based on fasting-state plasma and erythrocyte metabolomics and whole-genome genotyping. We show that personalized kinetic rate constants, rather than metabolite levels, better represent the genotype. Additionally, changes in erythrocyte dynamics between individuals occur on timescales of circulation, suggesting detected differences play a role in physiology. Finally, we use the models to identify individuals at risk for a drug side effect (ribavirin-induced anemia) and how genetic variation (inosine triphosphatase deficiency) may protect against this side effect. This study demonstrates the feasibility of personalized kinetic models, and we anticipate their use will accelerate discoveries in characterizing individual metabolic variation.},

	Abstract = {Mathematical models have long been used for prediction of dynamics in biological systems. Recently, several efforts have been made to render these models patient specific. One way to do so is to employ techniques to estimate parameters that enable model based prediction of observed quantities. Knowledge of variation in parameters within and between groups of subjects have potential to provide insight into biological function. Often it is not possible to estimate all parameters in a given model, in particular if the model is complex and the data is sparse. However, it may be possible to estimate a subset of model parameters reducing the complexity of the problem. In this study, we compare three methods that allow identification of parameter subsets that can be estimated given a model and a set of data. These methods will be used to estimate patient specific parameters in a model predicting baroreceptor feedback regulation of heart rate during head-up tilt. The three methods include: structured analysis of the correlation matrix, analysis via singular value decomposition followed by QR factorization, and identification of the subspace closest to the one spanned by eigenvectors of the model Hessian. Results showed that all three methods facilitate identification of a parameter subset. The "best" subset was obtained using the structured correlation method, though this method was also the most computationally intensive. Subsets obtained using the other two methods were easier to compute, but analysis revealed that the final subsets contained correlated parameters. In conclusion, to avoid lengthy computations, these three methods may be combined for efficient identification of parameter subsets.},

	Abstract = {Fibrin plays an essential role in hemostasis as both the primary product of the coagulation cascade and the ultimate substrate for fibrinolysis. Fibrinolysis efficiency is greatly influenced by clot structure, fibrinogen isoforms and polymorphisms, the rate of thrombin generation, the reactivity of thrombus-associated cells such as platelets, and the overall biochemical environment. Regulation of the fibrinolytic system, like that of the coagulation cascade, is accomplished by a wide array of cofactors, receptors, and inhibitors. Fibrinolytic activity can be generated either on the surface of a fibrin-containing thrombus, or on cells that express profibrinolytic receptors. In a widening spectrum of clinical disorders, acquired and congenital defects in fibrinolysis contribute to disease morbidity, and new assays of global fibrinolysis now have potential predictive value in multiple clinical settings. Here, we summarize the basic elements of the fibrinolytic system, points of interaction with the coagulation pathway, and some recent clinical advances.},

Galaxy allows users to seamlessly customize and run simulations on cloud computing resources, a concept we refer to as Models and Simulations as a Service (MaSS). To illustrate this application of Galaxy, we have developed a tool suite for simulating a high spatial-resolution model of the cardiac Ca(2+) spark that requires supercomputing resources for execution. We also present tools for simulating models encoded in the SBML and CellML model description languages, thus demonstrating how Galaxy's reproducible research features can be leveraged by existing technologies. Finally, we demonstrate how the Galaxy workflow editor can be used to compose integrative models from constituent submodules. This work represents an important novel approach, to our knowledge, to making computational simulations more accessible to the broader scientific community.},

The model describes a key architectural feature of ATRA-induced differen- tiation, positive feedback between an ATRA-inducible signalsome complex involving many proteins including Vav1, a guanine nucleotide exchange factor, and the activation of the mitogen activated protein kinase (MAPK) cascade. The model, which was developed by integrating logical rules with kinetic model- ing, was significantly smaller than previous models. However, despite its simplicity, it captured key features of ATRA induced differentiation of HL-60 cells. We identified an ensemble of effec- tive model parameters using measurements taken from ATRA- induced HL-60 cells. Using these parameters, model analysis predicted that MAPK activation was bistable as a function of ATRA exposure. Conformational experiments supported ATRA- induced bistability. These findings, combined with other literature evidence, suggest that positive feedback is central to a diversity of cell fate programs.},

	Abstract = {Complement is an important pathway in innate immunity, inflammation, and many disease processes. However, despite its importance, there have been few validated mathematical models of complement activation. In this study, we developed an ensemble of experimentally validated reduced order complement models. We combined ordinary differential equations with logical rules to produce a compact yet predictive complement model. The model, which described the lectin and alternative pathways, was an order of magnitude smaller than comparable models in the literature. We estimated an ensemble of model parameters from in vitro dynamic measurements of the C3a and C5a complement proteins. Subsequently, we validated the model on unseen C3a and C5a measurements not used for model training. Despite its small size, the model was surprisingly predictive. Global sensitivity and robustness analysis suggested complement was robust to any single therapeutic intervention. Only the knockdown of both C3 and C5 consistently reduced C3a and C5a formation from all pathways. Taken together, we developed a reduced order complement model that was computationally inexpensive, and could easily be incorporated into pre-existing or new pharmacokinetic models of immune system function. The model described experimental data, and predicted the need for multiple points of therapeutic intervention to fully disrupt complement activation.},

	Abstract = {There are currently few therapeutic options for patients with pancreatic cancer, and new insights into the pathogenesis of this lethal disease are urgently needed. Toward this end, we performed a comprehensive genetic analysis of 24 pancreatic cancers. We first determined the sequences of 23,219 transcripts, representing 20,661 protein-coding genes, in these samples. Then, we searched for homozygous deletions and amplifications in the tumor DNA by using microarrays containing probes for approximately 10(6) single-nucleotide polymorphisms. We found that pancreatic cancers contain an average of 63 genetic alterations, the majority of which are point mutations. These alterations defined a core set of 12 cellular signaling pathways and processes that were each genetically altered in 67 to 100% of the tumors. Analysis of these tumors' transcriptomes with next-generation sequencing-by-synthesis technologies provided independent evidence for the importance of these pathways and processes. Our data indicate that genetically altered core pathways and regulatory processes only become evident once the coding regions of the genome are analyzed in depth. Dysregulation of these core pathways and processes through mutation can explain the major features of pancreatic tumorigenesis.},

	Abstract = {Complex nonlinear dynamics arise in many fields of science and engineering, but uncovering the underlying differential equations directly from observations poses a challenging task. The ability to symbolically model complex networked systems is key to understanding them, an open problem in many disciplines. Here we introduce for the first time a method that can automatically generate symbolic equations for a nonlinear coupled dynamical system directly from time series data. This method is applicable to any system that can be described using sets of ordinary nonlinear differential equations, and assumes that the (possibly noisy) time series of all variables are observable. Previous automated symbolic modeling approaches of coupled physical systems produced linear models or required a nonlinear model to be provided manually. The advance presented here is made possible by allowing the method to model each (possibly coupled) variable separately, intelligently perturbing and destabilizing the system to extract its less observable characteristics, and automatically simplifying the equations during modeling. We demonstrate this method on four simulated and two real systems spanning mechanics, ecology, and systems biology. Unlike numerical models, symbolic models have explanatory value, suggesting that automated "reverse engineering" approaches for model-free symbolic nonlinear system identification may play an increasing role in our ability to understand progressively more complex systems in the future.},

We demonstrated previously that Oct-1, in association with a 40-kD protein, OAP40, contributes to the induction of interleukin-2 (IL-2), an early activation gene and major growth factor for T lymphocytes. Here we report that amino acid sequences obtained from purified OAP40 are identical to regions within JunD and c-Jun. We demonstrate that each of these Jun family members can participate in a complex that includes Oct-1 and a regulatory element in the IL-2 enhancer. In transient transfections, both JunD and c-Jun can contribute to activation-specific transcription mediated by this antigen receptor response element. These studies reveal a role, distinct from AP-1 activity, for Jun family members that is controlled by a calcium-triggered, cyclosporin A-sensitive mechanism.},

It is considered that the following four general properties are relevant for approximative kinetics: the rate must be proportional to enzyme level; at high metabolite concentrations, there is downward concave behavior of rate versus concentration; the number of kinetic parameters should be as small as possible; analytical solutions of steady-state network balances are desirable. Six different approximative kinetic formats are evaluated (linear, logarithmic-linear, power law GMA, power law S-systems, thermokinetic, linear-logarithmic) and it is concluded that only the recently proposed linear-logarithmic approach combines all desired properties and therefore seems a most appropriate approximate kinetic format.},

	Abstract = {Mechanistic biochemical network models describe the dynamics of intracellular metabolite pools in terms of substance concentrations, stoichiometry and reaction kinetics. Data from stimulus response experiments are currently the most informative source for in-vivo parameter estimation in such models. However, only a part of the parameters of classical enzyme kinetic models can usually be estimated from typical stimulus response data. For this reason, several alternative kinetic formats using different "languages'' (e. g. linear, power laws, linlog, generic and convenience) have been proposed to reduce the model complexity. The present contribution takes a rigorous "multi-lingual'' approach to data evaluation by translating biochemical network models from one kinetic format into another. For this purpose, a new high-performance algorithm has been developed and tested. Starting with a given model, it replaces as many kinetic terms as possible by alternative expressions while still reproducing the experimental data. Application of the algorithm to a published model for Escherichia coli's sugar metabolism demonstrates the power of the new method. It is shown that model translation is a powerful tool to investigate the information content of stimulus response data and the predictive power of models. Moreover, the local and global approximation capabilities of the models are elucidated and some pitfalls of traditional single model approaches to data evaluation are revealed. (C) 2008 Elsevier Inc.

@article{1991_savageau_JTheorBio,
	Abstract = {An appropriate language or formalism for the analysis of complex biochemical systems has been sought for several decades. The necessity for such a formalism results from the large number of interacting components in biochemical systems and the complex non-linear character of these interactions. The Power-Law Formalism, an example of such a language, underlies several recent attempts to develop an understanding of integrated biochemical systems. It is the simplest representation of integrated biochemical systems that has been shown to be consistent with well-known growth laws and allometric relationships--the most regular, quantitative features that have been observed among the systemic variables of complex biochemical systems. The Power-Law Formalism provides the basis for Biochemical Systems Theory, which includes several different strategies of representation. Among these, the synergistic-system (S-system) representation is the most useful, as judged by a variety of objective criteria. This paper first describes the predominant features of the S-system representation. It then presents detailed comparisons between the S-system representation and other variants within Biochemical Systems Theory. These comparisons are made on the basis of objective criteria that characterize the efficiency, power, clarity and scope of each representation. Two of the variants within Biochemical Systems Theory are intimately related to other approaches for analyzing biochemical systems, namely Metabolic Control Theory and Flux-Oriented Theory. It is hoped that the comparisons presented here will result in a deeper understanding of the relationships among these variants. Finally, some recent developments are described that demonstrate the potential for further growth of Biochemical Systems Theory and the underlying Power-Law Formalism on which it is based.},

	Abstract = {This paper presents a new mathematical framework for modeling of in vivo dynamics and for metabolic re-design: the linlog approach. This approach is an extension of metabolic control analysis (MCA), valid for large changes of enzyme and metabolite levels. Furthermore, the presented framework combines MCA with kinetic modeling, thereby also combining the merits of both approaches. The linlog framework includes general expressions giving the steady-state fluxes and metabolite concentrations as a function of enzyme levels and extracellular concentrations, and a metabolic design equation that allows direct calculation of required enzyme levels for a desired steady state when control and response coefficients are available. Expressions giving control coefficients as a function of the enzyme levels are also derived. The validity of the linlog approximation in metabolic modeling is demonstrated by application of linlog kinetics to a branched pathway with moiety conservation, reversible reactions and allosteric interactions. Results show that the linlog approximation is able to describe the non-linear dynamics of this pathway very well for concentration changes up to a factor 20. Also the metabolic design equation was tested successfully.},

	Abstract = {BACKGROUND: Recent advances in molecular biology techniques provide an opportunity for developing detailed mathematical models of biological processes. An iterative scheme is introduced for model identification using available system knowledge and experimental measurements.
RESULTS: The scheme includes a state regulator algorithm that provides estimates of all system unknowns (concentrations of the system components and the reaction rates of their inter-conversion). The full system information is used for estimation of the model parameters. An optimal experiment design using the parameter identifiability and D-optimality criteria is formulated to provide "rich" experimental data for maximizing the accuracy of the parameter estimates in subsequent iterations. The importance of model identifiability tests for optimal measurement selection is also considered. The iterative scheme is tested on a model for the caspase function in apoptosis where it is demonstrated that model accuracy improves with each iteration. Optimal experiment design was determined to be critical for model identification.
CONCLUSION: The proposed algorithm has general application to modeling a wide range of cellular processes, which include gene regulation networks, signal transduction and metabolic networks.},

The growth of the organisms is described in a bioreactor in which one substrate is fed into the reactor with a given feed rate and feed concentration. Measurements for some intracellular components are provided representing a small biochemical network. Problems of reverse engineering, parameter estimation, and identifiability are addressed. The contribution mainly focuses on the problem of model discrimination. If two or more model variants describe the available experimental data, a new experiment must be designed to discriminate between the hypothetical models. For the problem presented, the feed rate and feed concentration of a bioreactor system are available as control inputs. To verify calculated input profiles an interactive Web site (http://www.sysbio.de/projects/benchmark/) is provided. Several solutions based on linear and nonlinear models are discussed.},

	Abstract = {Mathematical modeling of complex gene expression programs is an emerging tool for understanding disease mechanisms. However, identification of large models sometimes requires training using qualitative, conflicting or even contradictory data sets. One strategy to address this challenge is to estimate experimentally constrained model ensembles using multiobjective optimization. In this study, we used Pareto Optimal Ensemble Techniques (POETs) to identify a family of proof-of-concept signal transduction models. POETs integrate Simulated Annealing (SA) with Pareto optimality to identify models near the optimal tradeoff surface between competing training objectives. We modeled a prototypical-signaling network using mass-action kinetics within an ordinary differential equation (ODE) framework (64 ODEs in total). The true model was used to generate synthetic immunoblots from which the POET algorithm identified the 117 unknown model parameters. POET generated an ensemble of signaling models, which collectively exhibited population-like behavior. For example, scaled gene expression levels were approximately normally distributed over the ensemble following the addition of extracellular ligand. Also, the ensemble recovered robust and fragile features of the true model, despite significant parameter uncertainty. Taken together, these results suggest that experimentally constrained model ensembles could capture qualitatively important network features without exact parameter information.},

However, there are no methods to systematically identify functional allosteric protein-metabolite interactions. Here we present an experimental and computational approach for using dynamic metabolite data to discover allosteric regulation that is relevant in vivo. By switching the culture conditions of Escherichia coli every 30 s between medium containing either pyruvate or (13)C-labeled fructose or glucose, we measured the reversal of flux through glycolysis pathways and observed rapid changes in metabolite concentration. We fit these data to a kinetic model of glycolysis and systematically tested the consequences of 126 putative allosteric interactions on metabolite dynamics. We identified allosteric interactions that govern the reversible switch between gluconeogenesis and glycolysis, including one by which pyruvate activates fructose-1,6-bisphosphatase. Thus, from large sets of putative allosteric interactions, our approach can identify the most likely ones and provide hypotheses about their function.},

	Abstract = {Complete modeling of metabolic networks is desirable, but it is difficult to accomplish because of the lack of kinetics. As a step toward this goal, we have developed an approach to build an ensemble of dynamic models that reach the same steady state. The models in the ensemble are based on the same mechanistic framework at the elementary reaction level, including known regulations, and span the space of all kinetics allowable by thermodynamics. This ensemble allows for the examination of possible phenotypes of the network upon perturbations, such as changes in enzyme expression levels. The size of the ensemble is reduced by acquiring data for such perturbation phenotypes. If the mechanistic framework is approximately accurate, the ensemble converges to a smaller set of models and becomes more predictive. This approach bypasses the need for detailed characterization of kinetic parameters and arrives at a set of models that describes relevant phenotypes upon enzyme perturbations.},

	Abstract = {The hybrid cybernetic modeling approach of Kim et al. (Kim et al. [2008] Biotechnol. Prog., in press) views the substrate uptake flux in microorganisms as being distributed in a regulated way among different elementary modes (EMs) of a metabolic network, which intracellular fluxes related to the uptake rates by the pseudo-steady-state approximation on intracellular metabolites. While the conceptual development has been demonstrated by Kim et al. (Kim et al. [2008] Biotechnol. Prog., in press) using a rather simple example (i.e., Escherichia coli metabolizing a single substrate), its extension to a larger scale network involving multiple substrates results in serious overparameterization (which implies an excessive number of parameters relative to the measurements available to determine them). Through the case study of recombinant Saccharomyces yeast co-consuming glucose and xylose, we present a systematic way of formulating a minimal order hybrid cybernetic model (HCM) for a general metabolic network. The overparameterization problem mostly arising from a large number of EMs is avoided using a model reduction technique developed by Song and Ramkrishna (Song and Ramkrishna [2009a] Biotechnol. Bioeng. 102(2):554-568) where an original set of EMs is condensed to a much smaller subset. Detailed discussions follow on the issue of determining the minimal set of active modes needed for the description of the simultaneous consumption of multiple substrates. The developed HCM is compared with other metabolic models: macroscopic bioreaction models (Provost et al. [2006] Bioprocess Biosyt. Eng. 29(5-6):349-366), and dynamic flux balance analysis. It is shown that the HCM outperforms the other two as validated using various sets of fermentation data. The difference among the models is more dramatic in a situation such as the sequential utilization of glucose and xylose, which is observed under realistic fermentation conditions.},

A complete catalytic cycle has been reconstructed based on available information on the oligomeric structure of the enzyme and kinetic mechanism of its monomer. Applying the generalization of the Monod-Wyman-Changeux approach proposed by Popova and Sel'kov(35-37) to the reconstructed catalytic cycle rate equation has been derived. Dependence of the reaction rate on pH, magnesium, and effectors has been taken into account. Kinetic parameters have been estimated via fitting the rate equation against experimentally measured dependencies of initial rate on substrates, products, effectors, and pH available from the literature. The model of phosphofructokinase-1 predicts (1) cooperativity of binding both fructose-6-phosphate and ATPMg(2-), (2) significant inhibition of the enzyme resulting from an increase in total concentration of ATP under the condition of fixed concentration of Mg(2+) ions, and (3) dual effect of ADP consisting of allosteric activation and product inhibition of the enzyme. Moreover, the model developed can be used in the kinetic modeling of biochemical pathways containing phosphofructokinase-1.},

	Abstract = {Insulin, the primary hormone regulating the level of glucose in the bloodstream, modulates a variety of cellular and enzymatic processes in normal and diseased cells. Insulin signals are processed by a complex network of biochemical interactions which ultimately induce gene expression programs or other processes such as translation initiation. Surprisingly, despite the wealth of literature on insulin signaling, the relative importance of the components linking insulin with translation initiation remains unclear. We addressed this question by developing and interrogating a family of mathematical models of insulin induced translation initiation. The insulin network was modeled using mass-action kinetics within an ordinary differential equation (ODE) framework. A family of model parameters was estimated, starting from an initial best fit parameter set, using 24 experimental data sets taken from literature. The residual between model simulations and each of the experimental constraints were simultaneously minimized using multiobjective optimization. Interrogation of the model population, using sensitivity and robustness analysis, identified an insulin-dependent switch that controlled translation initiation. Our analysis suggested that without insulin, a balance between the pro-initiation activity of the GTP-binding protein Rheb and anti-initiation activity of PTEN controlled basal initiation. On the other hand, in the presence of insulin a combination of PI3K and Rheb activity controlled inducible initiation, where PI3K was only critical in the presence of insulin. Other well known regulatory mechanisms governing insulin action, for example IRS-1 negative feedback, modulated the relative importance of PI3K and Rheb but did not fundamentally change the signal flow.},

In this study, the authors constructed an ensemble of mathematical models describing the integration of growth factor signals with translation initiation. Using these models, the authors estimated critical structural features of the translation architecture. Sensitivity and robustness analysis with and without growth factors suggested that a balance between competing regulatory programmes governed translation initiation. Proteins such as Akt and mTor promoted initiation by integrating growth factor signals with the assembly of the 80S initiation complex. However, negative regulators such as PTEN and 4EBP1 restrained initiation in the absence of stimulation. Other proteins such as eIF4E were also found to be structurally critical as deletion of amplification of these components resulted in a network incapable of nominal operation. These findings could help understand the molecular basis of translation deregulation observed in cancer and perhaps lead to new anti-cancer therapeutic strategies.

	Abstract = {Manipulation of differentiation programs has therapeutic potential in a spectrum of human cancers and neurodegenerative disorders. In this study, we integrated computational and experimental methods to unravel the response of a lineage uncommitted precursor cell-line, HL-60, to Retinoic Acid (RA). HL-60 is a human myeloblastic leukemia cell-line used extensively to study human differentiation programs. Initially, we focused on the role of the BLR1 receptor in RA-induced differentiation and G1/0-arrest in HL-60. BLR1, a putative G protein-coupled receptor expressed following RA exposure, is required for RA-induced cell-cycle arrest and differentiation and causes persistent MAPK signaling. A mathematical model of RA-induced cell-cycle arrest and differentiation was formulated and tested against BLR1 wild-type (wt) knock-out and knock-in HL-60 cell-lines with and without RA. The current model described the dynamics of 729 proteins and protein complexes interconnected by 1356 interactions. An ensemble strategy was used to compensate for uncertain model parameters. The ensemble of HL-60 models recapitulated the positive feedback between BLR1 and MAPK signaling. The ensemble of models also correctly predicted Rb and p47phox regulation and the correlation between p21-CDK4-cyclin D formation and G1/0-arrest following exposure to RA. Finally, we investigated the robustness of the HL-60 network architecture to structural perturbations and generated experimentally testable hypotheses for future study. Taken together, the model presented here was a first step toward a systematic framework for analysis of programmed differentiation. These studies also demonstrated that mechanistic network modeling can help prioritize experimental directions by generating falsifiable hypotheses despite uncertainty.},

	Abstract = {Androgen ablation therapy is currently the primary treatment for metastatic prostate cancer. Unfortunately, in nearly all cases, androgen ablation fails to permanently arrest cancer progression. As androgens like testosterone are withdrawn, prostate cancer cells lose their androgen sensitivity and begin to proliferate without hormone growth factors. In this study, we constructed and analyzed a mathematical model of the integration between hormone growth factor signaling, androgen receptor activation, and the expression of cyclin D and Prostate-Specific Antigen in human LNCaP prostate adenocarcinoma cells. The objective of the study was to investigate which signaling systems were important in the loss of androgen dependence. The model was formulated as a set of ordinary differential equations which described 212 species and 384 interactions, including both the mRNA and protein levels for key species. An ensemble approach was chosen to constrain model parameters and to estimate the impact of parametric uncertainty on model predictions. Model parameters were identified using 14 steady-state and dynamic LNCaP data sets taken from literature sources. Alterations in the rate of Prostatic Acid Phosphatase expression was sufficient to capture varying levels of androgen dependence. Analysis of the model provided insight into the importance of network components as a function of androgen dependence. The importance of androgen receptor availability and the MAPK/Akt signaling axes was independent of androgen status. Interestingly, androgen receptor availability was important even in androgen-independent LNCaP cells. Translation became progressively more important in androgen-independent LNCaP cells. Further analysis suggested a positive synergy between the MAPK and Akt signaling axes and the translation of key proliferative markers like cyclin D in androgen-independent cells. Taken together, the results support the targeting of both the Akt and MAPK pathways. Moreover, the analysis suggested that direct targeting of the translational machinery, specifically eIF4E, could be efficacious in androgen-independent prostate cancers.},

Unlike previous models, only mass action kinetics were used to describe the rate of molecular interactions. Thus, the majority of the 252 unknown model parameters were either association, dissociation or catalytic rate constants. Model parameters were estimated from nine independent data sets taken from multiple laboratories. The training data consisted of both dynamic and steady-state measurements. However, because of the complexity of the calcium network, we were unable to estimate unique model parameters. Instead, we estimated a family or ensemble of probable parameter sets using a multi-objective thermal ensemble method. Each member of the ensemble met an error criterion and was located along or near the optimal trade-off surface between the individual training data sets. The model quantitatively reproduced experimental measurements from dorsal root ganglion neurons as a function of extracellular ATP forcing. Hypothesized architecture linking phosphoinositide regulation with P2X receptor activity explained the inhibition of P2X-mediated current flow by activated metabotropic P2Y receptors. Sensitivity analysis using individual and the whole system outputs suggested which molecular subsystems were most important following P2 activation. Taken together, modeling and analysis of ATP-induced P2 mediated calcium signaling generated qualitative insight into the critical interactions controlling ATP induced calcium dynamics. Understanding these critical interactions may prove useful for the design of the next generation of molecular pain management strategies.},

	Abstract = {The role that mechanistic mathematical modeling and systems biology will play in molecular medicine and clinical development remains uncertain. In this study, mathematical modeling and sensitivity analysis were used to explore the working hypothesis that mechanistic models of human cascades, despite model uncertainty, can be computationally screened for points of fragility, and that these sensitive mechanisms could serve as therapeutic targets. We tested our working hypothesis by screening a model of the well-studied coagulation cascade, developed and validated from literature. The predicted sensitive mechanisms were then compared with the treatment literature. The model, composed of 92 proteins and 148 protein-protein interactions, was validated using 21 published datasets generated from two different quiescent in vitro coagulation models. Simulated platelet activation and thrombin generation profiles in the presence and absence of natural anticoagulants were consistent with measured values, with a mean correlation of 0.87 across all trials. Overall state sensitivity coefficients, which measure the robustness or fragility of a given mechanism, were calculated using a Monte Carlo strategy. In the absence of anticoagulants, fluid and surface phase factor X/activated factor X (fX/FXa) activity and thrombin-mediated platelet activation were found to be fragile, while fIX/FIXa and fVIII/FVIIIa activation and activity were robust. Both anti-fX/FXa and direct thrombin inhibitors are important classes of anticoagulants; for example, anti-fX/FXa inhibitors have FDA approval for the prevention of venous thromboembolism following surgical intervention and as an initial treatment for deep venous thrombosis and pulmonary embolism. Both in vitro and in vivo experimental evidence is reviewed supporting the prediction that fIX/FIXa activity is robust. When taken together, these results support our working hypothesis that computationally derived points of fragility of human relevant cascades could be used as a rational basis for target selection despite model uncertainty.},

	Abstract = {Models of biochemical regulation in prokaryotes and eukaryotes, typically consisting of a set of first-order nonlinear ordinary differential equations, have become increasingly popular of late. These systems have large numbers of poorly known parameters, simplified dynamics, and uncertain connectivity: three key features of a class of problems we call sloppy models, which are shared by many other high-dimensional multiparameter nonlinear models. We use a statistical ensemble method to study the behavior of these models, in order to extract as much useful predictive information as possible from a sloppy model, given the available data used to constrain it. We discuss numerical challenges that emerge in using the ensemble method for a large system. We characterize features of sloppy model parameter fluctuations by various spectral decompositions and find indeed that five parameters can be used to fit an elephant. We also find that model entropy is as important to the problem of model choice as model energy is to parameter choice.},

We trace the emergence of an effective theory for long-scale observables to a compression of the parameter space quantified by the eigenvalues of the Fisher Information Matrix. A similar compression appears ubiquitously in models taken from diverse areas of science, suggesting that the parameter space structure underlying effective continuum and universal theories in physics also permits predictive modeling more generally.},

	Abstract = {The control of poly-beta-hydroxybutyrate (PHB) productivity in a continuous bioreactor with cell recycle is studied by simulation. A cybernetic model of PHB synthesis in Alcaligenes eutrophus is developed. Model parameters are identified using experimental data, and simulation results are presented. The model is interfaced to a multirate model predictive control (MPC) algorithm. PHB productivity and concentration are controlled by manipulating dilution rate and recycle ratio. Unmeasured time varying disturbances are imposed to study regulatory control performance, including unreachable setpoints. With proper controller tuning, the nonlinear MPC algorithm can track productivity and concentration setpoints despite a change in the sign of PHB productivity gain with respect to dilution rate. It is shown that the nonlinear MPC algorithm is able to track the maximum achievable productivity for unreachable setpoints under significant process/model mismatch. The impact of model uncertainty upon controller performance is explored. The multirate MPC algorithm is tested using three controllers employing models that vary in complexity of regulation. It is shown that controller performance deteriorates as a function of decreasing biological complexity.},

@article{Song:2010aa,
	Abstract = {Motivated by the need for a quick quantitative assessment of metabolic function without extensive data, we present an adaptation of the cybernetic framework, denoted as the lumped hybrid cybernetic model (L-HCM), which combines the attributes of the classical lumped cybernetic model (LCM) and the recently developed HCM. The basic tenet of L-HCM and HCM is the same, that is, they both view the uptake flux as being split among diverse pathways in an optimal way as a result of cellular regulation such that some chosen metabolic objective is realized. The L-HCM, however, portrays this flux distribution to occur in a hierarchical way, that is, first among lumped pathways, and next among individual elementary modes (EM) in each lumped pathway. Both splits are described by the cybernetic control laws using operational and structural return-on-investments, respectively. That is, the distribution of uptake flux at the first split is dynamically regulated according to environmental conditions, while the subsequent split is based purely on the stoichiometry of EMs. The resulting model is conveniently represented in terms of lumped pathways which are fully identified with respect to yield coefficients of all products unlike classical LCMs based on instinctive lumping. These characteristics enable the model to account for the complete set of EMs for arbitrarily large metabolic networks despite containing only a small number of parameters which can be identified using minimal data. However, the inherent conflict of questing for quantification of larger networks with smaller number of parameters cannot be resolved without a mechanism for parameter tuning of an empirical nature. In this work, this is accomplished by manipulating the relative importance of EMs by tuning the cybernetic control of mode-averaged enzyme activity with an empirical parameter. In a case study involving aerobic batch growth of Saccharomyces cerevisiae, L-HCM is compared with LCM. The former provides a much more satisfactory prediction than the latter when parameters are identified from a few primary metabolites. On the other hand, the classical model is more accurate than L-HCM when sufficient datasets are involved in parameter identification. In applying the two models to a chemostat scenario, L-HCM shows a reasonable prediction on metabolic shift from respiration to fermentation due to the Crabtree effect, which LCM predicts unsatisfactorily. While L-HCM appears amenable to expeditious estimates of metabolic function with minimal data, the more detailed dynamic models [such as HCM or those of Young et al. (Young et al., Biotechnol Bioeng, 2008; 100: 542-559)] are best suited for accurate treatment of metabolism when the potential of modern omic technology is fully realized. However, in view of the monumental effort surrounding the development of detailed models from extensive omic measurements, the preliminary insight into the behavior of a genotype and metabolic engineering directives that can come from L-HCM is indeed valuable.},

	Abstract = {In a recent article, Song and Ramkrishna (Song and Ramkrishna [2010]. Biotechnol Bioeng 106(2):271-284) proposed a lumped hybrid cybernetic model (L-HCM) towards extracting maximum information about metabolic function from a minimum of data. This approach views the total uptake flux as distributed among lumped elementary modes (L-EMs) so as to maximize a prescribed metabolic objective such as growth or uptake rate. L-EM is computed as a weighted average of EMs where the weights are related to the yields of vital products (i.e., biomass and ATP). In this article, we further enhance the predictive power of L-HCMs through modifications in lumping weights with additional parameters that can be tuned with data viewed to be critical. The resulting model is able to make predictions of diverse metabolic behaviors varying greatly with strain types as evidenced from case studies of anaerobic growth of various Escherichia coli strains. Incorporation of the new lumping formula into L-HCM remarkably improves model predictions with a few critical data, thus presenting L-HCM as a dynamic tool as being not only qualitatively correct but also quantitatively accurate.},

@article{Varner:2000aa,
	Abstract = {The capability to gather organism wide data has far outstripped the ability to understand it. Transforming large-scale data into a "better" cell requires tools that integrate physiology with its environment. One such tool is large-scale mathematical models that marry stoichiometry and kinetics with metabolic regulation and control. It is straightforward to determine stoichiometry (at least for central pathways), and kinetics can be roughly approximated where need be. However, the molecular details of the "metabolic wiring" managing the cell are often missing. Presented here is a surrogate for these missing details based on a simple premise; over evolutionary time, biological systems have developed objective-based programs that frugally manage gene expression and enzyme activity. Mathematically, this notion can be represented as sets of nonlinear control or "management" problems which, when solved in parallel with the model balances, offer a prediction of how gene expression and enzyme activity are modulated, in the absence of specific mechanistic details. We present a model of Escherichia coli central carbon metabolism, describing batch aerobic growth on glucose, in which transcription, translation, and activity of the gene products of 45 genes is "managed" using this approach. The model consists of 122 species (metabolites, enzymes, mRNA pools, and biomass) and describes 46 reactions (17 reversible). The model is identified (kinetic parameters as well as management structure) from metabolic flux ratio (METAFoR) analysis and physiological measurements. Simulations of a pyruvate kinase knockout strain are compared with experiments and it is shown the model is capable of accurately capturing the metabolic reprogramming resulting from the deletion. Analysis of the mRNA expression pattern, translational pattern and enzyme activity pattern of the wild-type versus mutant indicates a combination of expression and specific activity shifts are responsible for observed differences. While being only a first step toward large-scale physiological modeling, this work is important in two ways. First, it strengthens the hypothesis that unknown mechanism can be reasonably approximated using objective-based management criteria. Second, it provides a dynamic means to couple large-scale analysis technologies with physiology at the single-gene, single-protein level.},

	Abstract = {Metabolic engineering is the field of introducing genetic changes in organisms so as to modify their function towards synthesizing new products of high impact to society. However, engineered cells frequently have impaired growth rates thus seriously limiting the rate at which such products are made. The problem is attributable to inadequate understanding of how a metabolic network functions in a dynamic sense. Predictions of mutant strain behavior in the past have been based on steady state theories such as flux balance analysis (FBA), minimization of metabolic adjustment (MOMA), and regulatory on/off minimization (ROOM). Such predictions are restricted to product yields and cannot address productivity, which is of focal interest to applications. We demonstrate that our framework ( [Song and Ramkrishna, 2010] and [Song and Ramkrishna, 2011]), based on a ``cybernetic'' view of metabolic systems, makes predictions of the dynamic behavior of mutant strains of Escherichia coli from a limited amount of data obtained from the wild-type. Dynamic frameworks must necessarily address the issue of metabolic regulation, which the cybernetic approach does by postulating that metabolism is an optimal dynamic response of the organism to the environment in driving reactions towards ensuring survival. The predictions made in this paper are without parallel in the literature and lay the foundation for rational metabolic engineering.},

Here we have reconstructed, on the basis of information derived from literature and databases, the first integrated genome-scale computational model of a transcriptional regulatory and metabolic network. The model accounts for 1,010 genes in Escherichia coli, including 104 regulatory genes whose products together with other stimuli regulate the expression of 479 of the 906 genes in the reconstructed metabolic network. This model is able not only to predict the outcomes of high-throughput growth phenotyping and gene expression experiments, but also to indicate knowledge gaps and identify previously unknown components and interactions in the regulatory and metabolic networks.

Mathematical analysis can be performed to assess the capabilities of these reconstructed networks. The constraints-based framework, with flux balance analysis (FBA), has been used successfully to predict time course of growth and by-product secretion, effects of mutation and knock-outs, and gene expression profiles. However, FBA leads to incorrect predictions in situations where regulatory effects are a dominant influence on the behavior of the organism. Thus, there is a need to include regulatory events within FBA to broaden its scope and predictive capabilities. Here we represent transcriptional regulatory events as time-dependent constraints on the capabilities of a reconstructed metabolic network to further constrain the space of possible network functions. Using a simplified metabolic/regulatory network, growth is simulated under various conditions to illustrate systemic effects such as catabolite repression, the aerobic/anaerobic diauxic shift and amino acid biosynthesis pathway repression. The incorporation of transcriptional regulatory events in FBA enables us to interpret, analyse and predict the effects of transcriptional regulation on cellular metabolism at the systemic level.},

	Abstract = {In this report, a genome-scale reconstruction of Bacillus subtilis metabolism and its iterative development based on the combination of genomic, biochemical, and physiological information and high-throughput phenotyping experiments is presented. The initial reconstruction was converted into an in silico model and expanded in a four-step iterative fashion. First, network gap analysis was used to identify 48 missing reactions that are needed for growth but were not found in the genome annotation. Second, the computed growth rates under aerobic conditions were compared with high-throughput phenotypic screen data, and the initial in silico model could predict the outcomes qualitatively in 140 of 271 cases considered. Detailed analysis of the incorrect predictions resulted in the addition of 75 reactions to the initial reconstruction, and 200 of 271 cases were correctly computed. Third, in silico computations of the growth phenotypes of knock-out strains were found to be consistent with experimental observations in 720 of 766 cases evaluated. Fourth, the integrated analysis of the large-scale substrate utilization and gene essentiality data with the genome-scale metabolic model revealed the requirement of 80 specific enzymes (transport, 53; intracellular reactions, 27) that were not in the genome annotation. Subsequent sequence analysis resulted in the identification of genes that could be putatively assigned to 13 intracellular enzymes. The final reconstruction accounted for 844 open reading frames and consisted of 1020 metabolic reactions and 988 metabolites. Hence, the in silico model can be used to obtain experimentally verifiable hypothesis on the metabolic functions of various genes.},

	Abstract = {An updated genome-scale reconstruction of the metabolic network in Escherichia coli K-12 MG1655 is presented. This updated metabolic reconstruction includes: (1) an alignment with the latest genome annotation and the metabolic content of EcoCyc leading to the inclusion of the activities of 1260 ORFs, (2) characterization and quantification of the biomass components and maintenance requirements associated with growth of E. coli and (3) thermodynamic information for the included chemical reactions. The conversion of this metabolic network reconstruction into an in silico model is detailed. A new step in the metabolic reconstruction process, termed thermodynamic consistency analysis, is introduced, in which reactions were checked for consistency with thermodynamic reversibility estimates. Applications demonstrating the capabilities of the genome-scale metabolic model to predict high-throughput experimental growth and gene deletion phenotypic screens are presented. The increased scope and computational capability using this new reconstruction is expected to broaden the spectrum of both basic biology and applied systems biology studies of E. coli metabolism.},

	Abstract = {Eukaryotic cell-free protein synthesis (CFPS) systems are limited, in part, by inefficient translation initiation. Here, we report three internal ribosome entry site (IRES) sequences from the Dicistroviridae family that are highly active in yeast CFPS. These include the intergenic region (IGR) IRES from cricket paralysis virus (CrPV), plautia stali intestine virus (PSIV) and Solenopsis invicta virus 1 (SINV1). Optimization of combined transcription and translation (Tx/Tl) CFPS reactions primed with linear DNA containing the CrPV IGR IRES resulted in batch synthesis yields of 0.92$\pm$0.17μg/mL luciferase. Further template engineering, such as including the first 12 nt of native CrPV gene, increased yields to 2.33$\pm$0.11μg/mL. We next observed that the inclusion of a 50 nt poly(A) to the 3' end of the IGR IRES-mediated message increased yields an additional 81% to 4.33$\pm$0.37μg/mL, without any effect on mRNA stability or copy number. This was surprising because the CrPV IGR IRES requires no known translation initiation factors. Lastly, we investigated a method to inhibit background expression through competitive inhibition by supplying the reaction with 5' cap structure analog. This study highlights the crucial role translation initiation plays in yeast CFPS and offers a simple platform to study IRES sequences.},

	Abstract = {Cell-free protein synthesis (CFPS) platforms are now considered a powerful tool for synthesizing a variety of proteins at scales from pL to 100 L with accelerated process development pipelines. We previously reported the advancement of a novel yeast-based CFPS platform. Here, we studied factors that cause termination of yeast CFPS batch reactions. Specifically, we characterized the substrate and byproduct concentrations in batch, fed-batch, and semi-continuous reaction formats through high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) and chemical assays. We discovered that creatine phosphate, the secondary energy substrate, and nucleoside triphosphates were rapidly degraded during batch CFPS, causing a significant drop in the reaction's energy charge (E.C.) and eventual termination of protein synthesis. As a consequence of consuming creatine phosphate, inorganic phosphate accumulated as a toxic byproduct. Additionally, we measured amino acid concentrations and found that aspartic acid was rapidly consumed. By adopting a semi-continuous reaction format, where passive diffusion enables substrate replenishment and byproduct removal, we achieved over a 70% increase in active superfolder green fluorescent protein (sfGFP) as compared with the batch system. This study identifies targets for the future improvement of the batch yeast CFPS reaction. Moreover, it outlines a detailed, generalized method to characterize and improve other CFPS platforms.},

In this article, we describe a novel CFPS platform derived from the popular bio-manufacturing organism Saccharomyces cerevisiae. By developing a streamlined crude extract preparation protocol and optimizing the CFPS reaction conditions we were able to achieve active firefly luciferase synthesis yields of 7.7 $\pm$ 0.5 µg mL(-1) with batch reactions lasting up to 2 h. This duration of synthesis is the longest ever reported for a yeast CFPS batch reaction. Furthermore, by removing extraneous processing steps and eliminating expensive reagents from the cell-free reaction, we have increased relative product yield (µg protein synthesized per $ reagent cost) over an alternative commonly used method up to 2000-fold from ∼2 × 10(-4) to ∼4 × 10(-1)  µg $(-1) , which now puts the yeast CPFS platform on par with other eukaryotic CFPS platforms commercially available. Our results set the stage for developing a yeast CFPS platform that provides for high-yielding and cost-effective expression of a variety of protein therapeutics and protein libraries.},

Cell-free systems bypass cell walls and remove genetic regulation to enable direct access to the inner workings of the cell. The unprecedented level of control and freedom of design, relative to in vivo systems, has inspired the rapid development of engineering foundations for cell-free systems in recent years. These efforts have led to programmed circuits, spatially organized pathways, co-activated catalytic ensembles, rational optimization of synthetic multi-enzyme pathways, and linear scalability from the micro-liter to the 100-liter scale. It is now clear that cell-free systems offer a versatile test-bed for understanding why nature's designs work the way they do and also for enabling biosynthetic routes to novel chemicals, sustainable fuels, and new classes of tunable materials. While challenges remain, the emergence of cell-free systems is poised to open the way to novel products that until now have been impractical, if not impossible, to produce by other means.},

	Abstract = {The rapid dissemination of the 2009 pandemic H1N1 influenza virus emphasizes the need for universal influenza vaccines that would broadly protect against multiple mutated strains. Recent efforts have focused on the highly conserved hemagglutinin (HA) stem domain, which must undergo a significant conformational change for effective viral infection. Although the production of isolated domains of multimeric ectodomain proteins has proven difficult, we report a method to rapidly produce the properly folded HA stem domain protein from influenza virus A/California/05/2009 (H1N1) by using Escherichia coli-based cell-free protein synthesis and a simple refolding protocol. The T4 bacteriophage fibritin foldon placed at the C terminus of the HA stem domain induces trimer formation. Placing emphasis on newly exposed protein surfaces, several hydrophobic residues were mutated, two polypeptide segments were deleted, and the number of disulfide bonds in each monomer was reduced from four to two. High pH and Brij 35 detergent emerged as the most beneficial factors for improving the refolding yield. To stabilize the trimer of the HA stem-foldon fusion, new intermolecular disulfide bonds were finally introduced between foldon monomers and between stem domain monomers. The correct immunogenic conformation of the stabilized HA stem domain trimer was confirmed by using antibodies CR6261, C179, and FI6 that block influenza infection by binding to the HA stem domain trimer. These results suggest great promise for a broadly protective vaccine and also demonstrate a unique approach for producing individual domains of complex multimeric proteins.},

Cell-free systems, however, have been limited by their inability to co-activate multiple biochemical networks in a single integrated platform. Here, we report the assessment of biochemical reactions in an Escherichia coli cell-free platform designed to activate natural metabolism, the Cytomim system. We reveal that central catabolism, oxidative phosphorylation, and protein synthesis can be co-activated in a single reaction system. Never before have these complex systems been shown to be simultaneously activated without living cells. The Cytomim system therefore promises to provide the metabolic foundation for diverse ab initio cell-free synthetic biology projects. In addition, we describe an improved Cytomim system with enhanced protein synthesis yields (up to 1200 mg/l in 2 h) and lower costs to facilitate production of protein therapeutics and biochemicals that are difficult to make in vivo because of their toxicity, complexity, or unusual cofactor requirements.},

	Abstract = {Over the past decade a massive amount of research has been dedicated to generating omics data to gain insight into a variety of biological phenomena, including cancer, obesity, biofuel production, and infection. Although most of these omics data are available publicly, there is a growing concern that much of these data sit in databases without being used or fully analyzed. Statistical inference methods have been widely applied to gain insight into which genes may influence the activities of others in a given omics data set, however, they do not provide information on the underlying mechanisms or whether the interactions are direct or distal. Biochemically, genetically, and genomically consistent knowledge bases are increasingly being used to extract deeper biological knowledge and understanding from these data sets than possible by inferential methods. This improvement is largely due to knowledge bases providing a validated biological context for interpreting the data.},

	Abstract = {The genome-scale model (GEM) of metabolism in the bacterium Escherichia coli K-12 has been in development for over a decade and is now in wide use. GEM-enabled studies of E. coli have been primarily focused on six applications: (1) metabolic engineering, (2) model-driven discovery, (3) prediction of cellular phenotypes, (4) analysis of biological network properties, (5) studies of evolutionary processes, and (6) models of interspecies interactions. In this review, we provide an overview of these applications along with a critical assessment of their successes and limitations, and a perspective on likely future developments in the field. Taken together, the studies performed over the past decade have established a genome-scale mechanistic understanding of genotype-phenotype relationships in E. coli metabolism that forms the basis for similar efforts for other microbial species. Future challenges include the expansion of GEMs by integrating additional cellular processes beyond metabolism, the identification of key constraints based on emerging data types, and the development of computational methods able to handle such large-scale network models with sufficient accuracy.},

By explicitly considering experimental errors and in silico alternate optima in flux balance analysis, we systematically evaluate the capacity of 11 objective functions combined with eight adjustable constraints to predict (13)C-determined in vivo fluxes in Escherichia coli under six environmental conditions. While no single objective describes the flux states under all conditions, we identified two sets of objectives for biologically meaningful predictions without the need for further, potentially artificial constraints. Unlimited growth on glucose in oxygen or nitrate respiring batch cultures is best described by nonlinear maximization of the ATP yield per flux unit. Under nutrient scarcity in continuous cultures, in contrast, linear maximization of the overall ATP or biomass yields achieved the highest predictive accuracy. Since these particular objectives predict the system behavior without preconditioning of the network structure, the identified optimality principles reflect, to some extent, the evolutionary selection of metabolic network regulation that realizes the various flux states.},

These metabolic networks can be modelled and analysed (computed) to study complex biological functions. In particular, constraints-based in silico models have been used to calculate optimal growth rates on common carbon substrates, and the results were found to be consistent with experimental data under many but not all conditions. Optimal biological functions are acquired through an evolutionary process. Thus, incorrect predictions of in silico models based on optimal performance criteria may be due to incomplete adaptive evolution under the conditions examined. Escherichia coli K-12 MG1655 grows sub-optimally on glycerol as the sole carbon source. Here we show that when placed under growth selection pressure, the growth rate of E. coli on glycerol reproducibly evolved over 40 days, or about 700 generations, from a sub-optimal value to the optimal growth rate predicted from a whole-cell in silico model. These results open the possibility of using adaptive evolution of entire metabolic networks to realize metabolic states that have been determined a priori based on in silico analysis.},

Experiments with a feed mixture of glucose and pyruvate show multiple steady state behavior as predicted by the cybernetic model. When multiplicity occurs at a dilution (growth) rate, it results in hysteretic behavior following switches in dilution rate from above and below. This phenomenon is caused by transient paths leading to different steady states through dynamic maximization of the carbon uptake rate. Thus steady state multiplicity is a manifestation of the nonlinearity arising from cybernetic mechanisms rather than of the nonlinear kinetics. The predicted metabolic multiplicity would extend to intracellular states such as enzyme levels and fluxes to be verified in future experiments.},

The stoichiometric coefficients for each metabolic enzyme in the E. coli metabolic map were assembled to construct a genome-specific stoichiometric matrix. The E. coli stoichiometric matrix was used to define the system's characteristics and the capabilities of E. coli metabolism. The effects of gene deletions in the central metabolic pathways on the ability of the in silico metabolic network to support growth were assessed, and the in silico predictions were compared with experimental observations. It was shown that based on stoichiometric and capacity constraints the in silico analysis was able to qualitatively predict the growth potential of mutant strains in 86% of the cases examined. Herein, it is demonstrated that the synthesis of in silico metabolic genotypes based on genomic, biochemical, and strain-specific information is possible, and that systems analysis methods are available to analyze and interpret the metabolic phenotype.},

The network model formulation is employed in the role of a diagnostic tool for the overproduction of threonine. More precisely, having determined a parameter set that describes the time evolution of a base strain (lysine producer), the model predicted response to genetic perturbations, designed to enhance the level of threonine, are simulated using an appropriately modified cybernetic model and compared with the experimental results of Stephanopoulos and Sinskey (Col{\'o}n et al., 1995a, Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 61, 74-78) for identical genetic perturbations. It is found that the model predicted response to enzymatic over-expression in the aspartate pathway agrees, for the most part, with experimental observations within the experimental error bounds. This result lends credence to the hypothesis that cybernetic models can be employed to predict the local response of a metabolic network to genetic perturbation, thereby, affording cognizance of the potential pitfalls of a particular genetic alteration strategy a priori.},

Such models would realistically describe fundamental properties of living systems such as growth, division and chromosome replication. This will inevitably bridge bioinformatic technologies with ongoing mathematical modelling efforts and would allow for in silico prediction of important dynamic physiological events. To demonstrate a potential for the anticipated merger of bioinformatic genome-wide data with a whole-cell computer model, the authors present here an updated version of a dynamic model of Escherichia coli, including a module that correctly describes the initiation and control of DNA replication by nucleoprotein DnaA-ATP molecules. Specifically, a rigorous mathematical approach used to explicitly include the genome-wide distribution of DnaA-binding sites on the replicating chromosome into a computer model of a bacterial cell is discussed. A new simple deterministic approximation of the complex stochastic process of DNA replication initiation is also provided. It is shown for the first time that reasonable assumptions about the mechanism of DNA replication initiation can be implemented in a deterministic whole-cell model to make predictions about the timing of chromosome replication. Furthermore, it is proposed that a large increase in the concentration of DnaA-binding boxes will result in a decreased steady-state growth rate in E. coli.},

	Abstract = {A more complete understanding of the relationship of cell physiology to genomic structure is desirable. Because of the intrinsic complexity of biological organisms, only the simplest cells will allow complete definition of all components and their interactions. The theoretical and experimental construction of a minimal cell has been suggested as a tool to develop such an understanding. Our ultimate goal is to convert a "coarse-grain" lumped parameter computer model of Escherichia coli into a genetically and chemically detailed model of a "minimal cell." The base E. coli model has been converted into a generalized model of a heterotrophic bacterium. This coarse-grain minimal cell model is functionally complete, with growth rate, composition, division, and changes in cell morphology as natural outputs from dynamic simulations where only the initial composition of the cell and of the medium are specified. A coarse-grain model uses pseudochemical species (or modules) that are aggregates of distinct chemical species that share similar chemistry and metabolic dynamics. This model provides a framework in which these modules can be "delumped" into chemical and genetic descriptions while maintaining connectivity to all other functional elements. Here we demonstrate that a detailed description of nucleotide precursors transport and metabolism is successfully integrated into the whole-cell model. This nucleotide submodel requires fewer (12) genes than other theoretical predictions in minimal cells. The demonstration of modularity suggests the possibility of developing modules in parallel and recombining them into a fully functional chemically and genetically detailed model of a prokaryote cell.},

	Abstract = {Predictive understanding of cell signaling network operation based on general prior knowledge but consistent with empirical data in a specific environmental context is a current challenge in computational biology. Recent work has demonstrated that Boolean logic can be used to create context-specific network models by training proteomic pathway maps to dedicated biochemical data; however, the Boolean formalism is restricted to characterizing protein species as either fully active or inactive. To advance beyond this limitation, we propose a novel form of fuzzy logic sufficiently flexible to model quantitative data but also sufficiently simple to efficiently construct models by training pathway maps on dedicated experimental measurements. Our new approach, termed constrained fuzzy logic (cFL), converts a prior knowledge network (obtained from literature or interactome databases) into a computable model that describes graded values of protein activation across multiple pathways. We train a cFL-converted network to experimental data describing hepatocytic protein activation by inflammatory cytokines and demonstrate the application of the resultant trained models for three important purposes: (a) generating experimentally testable biological hypotheses concerning pathway crosstalk, (b) establishing capability for quantitative prediction of protein activity, and (c) prediction and understanding of the cytokine release phenotypic response.

	Abstract = {We propose a mathematical model for mitochondria-dependent apoptosis, in which kinetic cooperativity in formation of the apoptosome is a key element ensuring bistability. We examine the role of Bax and Bcl-2 synthesis and degradation rates, as well as the number of mitochondrial permeability transition pores (MPTPs), on the cell response to apoptotic stimuli. Our analysis suggests that cooperative apoptosome formation is a mechanism for inducing bistability, much more robust than that induced by other mechanisms, such as inhibition of caspase-3 by the inhibitor of apoptosis (IAP). Simulations predict a pathological state in which cells will exhibit a monostable cell survival if Bax degradation rate is above a threshold value, or if Bax expression rate is below a threshold value. Otherwise, cell death or survival occur depending on initial caspase-3 levels. We show that high expression rates of Bcl-2 can counteract the effects of Bax. Our simulations also demonstrate a monostable (pathological) apoptotic response if the number of MPTPs exceeds a threshold value. This study supports our contention, based on mathematical modeling, that cooperativity in apoptosome formation is critically important for determining the healthy responses to apoptotic stimuli, and helps define the roles of Bax, Bcl-2, and MPTP vis-{\`a}-vis apoptosome formation.},

In mammals, there are three family members; Vav1 is specifically expressed in the hematopoietic system, whereas Vav2 and Vav3 are more ubiquitously expressed. Vav proteins contain multiple domains that enable their function in various fashions. The participation of the Vav proteins in several processes that require cytoskeletal reorganization, such as the formation of the immunological synapse (IS), phagocytosis, platelet aggregation, spreading, and transformation will be discussed in this review. We will also cover how the Vav proteins succeed in controlling these processes by their function as guanine nucleotide exchange factors (GEFs) for the Rho/Rac family of GTPases. The contribution of the Vav proteins in a GEF-independent manner to the organization of the cytoskeleton will also be deliberated. The scope of this review is to highlight the numerous roles of the Vav signal transducer proteins in actin organization.},

Systems of this sort are termed "bistable". Recently, several groups have engineered artificial bistable systems into Escherichia coli and Saccharomyces cerevisiae, and have shown that the systems exhibit interesting and potentially useful properties. In addition, two naturally occurring signaling systems, the p42 mitogen-activated protein kinase and c-Jun amino-terminal kinase pathways in Xenopus oocytes, have been shown to exhibit bistable responses. Here we review the basic properties of bistable circuits, the requirements for construction of a satisfactory bistable switch, and the recent progress towards constructing and analysing bistable signaling systems.},

Crucial mediators of Xenopus oocyte maturation, including the p42 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) and the cell-division cycle protein kinase Cdc2, are known to be organized into positive feedback loops. In principle, such positive feedback loops could produce an actively maintained 'memory' of a transient inductive stimulus and could explain the irreversibility of maturation. Here we show that the p42 MAPK and Cdc2 system normally generates an irreversible biochemical response from a transient stimulus, but the response becomes transient when positive feedback is blocked. Our results explain how a group of intrinsically reversible signal transducers can generate an irreversible response at a systems level, and show how a cell fate can be maintained by a self-sustaining pattern of protein kinase activation.},

	Abstract = {We have used HL-60 leukemia cells to investigate phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI 3-K) during granulocytic differentiation at the nuclear level. Nuclei of HL-60 cells showed a constitutive presence of PI 3-K that increased when cells were treated with differentiating doses of ATRA. PI 3-K was also detected tightly bound to nuclear matrices of HL-60 cells, isolated by nuclease treatment and high salt extraction. Four days of ATRA treatment induced a striking increase of nuclear matrix bound PI 3-K. In situ morphological analysis by confocal microscopy showed the translocation of PI 3-K to the nucleus and to the subnuclear fractions. PI 3-K enzymatic activity was stimulated during the granulocytic differentiation process and parallelled the increase in content of nuclei and subnuclear fractions. PI 3-K activity was recovered in nuclei also without the addition of exogenous substrates, consistent with the presence of both substrates and enzyme in the nucleus. These results indicate that specific intracellular localization of PI 3-K determines the production of different phosphoinositides in the sites of the enzyme translocation, and suggest that 3-phosphoinositide metabolism may play a specific role in the nucleus, candidating PI 3-K as a key enzyme in promoting granulocytic differentiation of HL-60 cells.},

	Abstract = {All-trans retinoic acid (RA) and interferons (IFNs) have efficacy in treating certain leukemias and lymphomas, respectively, motivating interest in their mechanism of action to improve therapy. Both RA and IFNs induce interferon regulatory factor-1 (IRF-1). We find that in HL-60 myeloblastic leukemia cells which undergo mitogen activated protien kinase (MAPK)-dependent myeloid differentiation in response to RA, IRF-1 propels differentiation. RA induces MAPK-dependent expression of IRF-1. IRF-1 binds c-Cbl, a MAPK related adaptor. Ectopic IRF-1 expression causes CD38 expression and activation of the Raf/MEK/ERK axis, and enhances RA-induced differentiation by augmenting CD38, CD11b, respiratory burst and G0 arrest. Ectopic IRF-1 expression also decreases the activity of aldehyde dehydrogenase 1, a stem cell marker, and enhances RA-induced ALDH1 down-regulation. Interestingly, expression of aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR), which is RA-induced and known to down-regulate Oct4 and drive RA-induced differentiation, also enhances IRF-1 expression. The data are consistent with a model whereby IRF-1 acts downstream of RA and AhR to enhance Raf/MEK/ERK activation and propel differentiation.},

@article{Asthagiri2001,
	Abstract = {Exploiting signaling pathways for the purpose of controlling cell
	function entails identifying and manipulating the information content
	of intracellular signals. As in the case of the ubiquitously expressed,
	eukaryotic mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signaling pathway,
	this information content partly resides in the signals' dynamical
	properties. Here, we utilize a mathematical model to examine mechanisms
	that govern MAPK pathway dynamics, particularly the role of putative
	negative feedback mechanisms in generating complete signal adaptation,
	a term referring to the reset of a signal to prestimulation levels.
	In addition to yielding adaptation of its direct target, feedback
	mechanisms implemented in our model also indirectly assist in the
	adaptation of signaling components downstream of the target under
	certain conditions. In fact, model predictions identify conditions
	yielding ultra-desensitization of signals in which complete adaptation
	of target and downstream signals culminates even while stimulus recognition
	(i.e., receptor-ligand binding) continues to increase. Moreover,
	the rate at which signal decays can follow first-order kinetics with
	respect to signal intensity, so that signal adaptation is achieved
	in the same amount of time regardless of signal intensity or ligand
	dose. All of these features are consistent with experimental findings
	recently obtained for the Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cell lines
	(Asthagiri et al., J. Biol. Chem. 1999, 274, 27119-27127). Our model
	further predicts that although downstream effects are independent
	of whether an enzyme or adaptor protein is targeted by negative feedback,
	adaptor-targeted feedback can "back-propagate" effects upstream of
	the target, specifically resulting in increased steady-state upstream
	signal. Consequently, where these upstream components serve as nodes
	within a signaling network, feedback can transfer signaling through
	these nodes into alternate pathways, thereby promoting the sort of
	signaling cross-talk that is becoming more widely appreciated.},

	Abstract = {The androgen receptor (AR) is a critical effector of prostate cancer
	development and progression. The dependence of this tumor type on
	AR activity is exploited in treatment of disseminated prostate cancers,
	wherein ablation of AR function (achieved either through ligand depletion
	and/or the use of AR antagonists) is the first line of therapeutic
	intervention. These strategies are initially effective, and induce
	a mixed response of cell cycle arrest or apoptosis in prostate cancer
	cells. However, recurrent, incurable tumors ultimately arise as a
	result of inappropriately restored AR function. Based on these observations,
	it is imperative to define the mechanisms by which AR controls cancer
	cell proliferation. Mechanistic investigation has revealed that AR
	acts as a master regulator of G1-S phase progression, able to induce
	signals that promote G1 cyclin-dependent kinase (CDK) activity, induce
	phosphorylation/inactivation of the retinoblastoma tumor suppressor
	(RB), and thereby govern androgen-dependent proliferation. These
	functions appear to be independent of the recently identified TMPRSS2-ETS
	fusions. Once engaged, several components of the cell cycle machinery
	actively modulate AR activity throughout the cell cycle, thus indicating
	that crosstalk between the AR and cell cycle pathways likely modulate
	the mitogenic response to androgen. As will be discussed, discrete
	aberrations in this process can alter the proliferative response
	to androgen, and potentially subvert hormonal control of tumor progression.},

	Abstract = {Retinoids are known to induce the differentiation and cell cycle arrest
	of human myeloid leukemia cells in vitro. Differential display was
	used to identify putative early regulatory genes that are differentially
	expressed in HL-60 human promyelocytic leukemia cells treated with
	retinoic acid. One of the cDNAs cloned encodes sequences identifying
	Burkitt's lymphoma receptor 1 (BLR1), a recently described chemokine
	receptor. Northern blot analysis demonstrates that blr1 mRNA expression
	increases within 9 h of retinoic acid treatment, well before functional
	differentiation or G(1)/G(0) growth arrest at 48 h or onset of morphological
	changes, suggesting a possible regulatory function. The expression
	of blr1 mRNA is transient, peaking at 72 h when cells are differentiated.
	blr1 mRNA also is induced by other differentiation-inducing agents,
	1alpha,25-dihydroxyvitamin D(3) and DMSO. Induction of blr1 mRNA
	by retinoic acid is not blocked by the protein synthesis inhibitor
	cycloheximide. In HL-60 cells stably transfected with blr1 cDNA,
	ectopic expression of blr1 causes an increase in ERK2 MAPK activation
	and promotes retinoic acid-induced G(1)/G(0) growth arrest and cell
	differentiation. The early expression of blr1 mRNA during differentiation,
	its ability to increase ERK2 activation, and its enhancement of retinoic
	acid-induced differentiation suggest that blr1 expression may be
	involved in retinoic acid-induced HL-60 differentiation.},

	many cellular machines, including the cell cycle machinery and autocrine/paracrine

	At low concentrations of MAPK phosphatase, the system exhibits bistable

	The MAPK-induced increase in the amounts of MAPK phosphatase eliminates
	the prolonged response capability and moves the network to a monostable
	state, in which it behaves as a proportional response system responding
	acutely to stimulus. Thus, the MAPK 1, 2/PKC controller network is

	Abstract = {We have examined the possible mechanisms of resistance to the epidermal
	growth factor receptor (EGFR) inhibitors in tumor cells with variable
	levels of EGFR. ZD1839 (Iressa) is a small-molecular-weight, ATP-mimetic
	that specifically inhibits the EGFR tyrosine kinase. A431 cell growth
	was markedly inhibited by ZD1839 (IC(50)< or =0.1 microM) whereas
	the MDA-468 cells were relatively resistant (IC(50)2 microM). Low
	doses of ZD1839 delayed cell cycle progression and induced apoptosis
	in A431 cells but not in MDA-468 cells. In both cell lines, 0.1 microM
	ZD1839 eliminated EGFR phosphorylation. However, the basal activity
	of the phosphatidylinositol-3 kinase (PI3 K) target Akt was eliminated
	in A431 but not in MDA-468 cells, implying that their Akt activity
	is independent of EGFR signals. A431 cells express PTEN/MMAC1/TEP,
	a phosphatase that can dephosphorylate position D3 of phosphatidylinositol-3,4,5
	trisphosphate, the site that recruits the plecstrin-homology domain
	of Akt to the cell membrane. On the contrary, MDA-468 cells lack
	the phosphatase and tensin homolog (PTEN), potentially setting Akt
	activity at a high threshold that is unresponsive to EGFR inhibition
	alone. Therefore, we reintroduced (PTEN) by retroviral infection
	in MDA-468 cells. In MDA-468/PTEN but not in vector controls, treatment
	with ZD1839 inhibited P-Akt levels, induced relocalization of the
	Forkhead factor FKHRL1 to the cell nucleus, and increased FKHRL1-dependent
	transcriptional activity. ZD1839 induced a greater degree of apoptosis
	and cell cycle delay in PTEN-reconstituted than in control cells.
	These data suggest that loss of PTEN, by permitting a high level
	of Akt activity independent of receptor tyrosine kinase inputs, can
	temporally dissociate the inhibition of the EGFR with that of Akt
	induced by EGFR inhibitors. Thus, in EGFR-expressing tumor cells
	with concomitant amplification(s) of PI3K-Akt signaling, combined
	blockade of the EGFR tyrosine kinase and Akt should be considered
	as a therapeutic approach.},

	a phosphoprotein and modulation of the phosphorylation status of

	analogs. RA analogs that selectively bind only to RARs (Am580 and/or
	TTNPB) or to RXRs (Ro 25-6603, SR11237, and/or SR11234) did not elicit
	the above-mentioned three cellular responses. In contrast, simultaneous
	treatment with both an RAR-selective ligand (Am580 or TTNPB) and
	an RXR-selective ligand (Ro 25-6603, SR11237, or SR11234) induced
	all three cellular processes. An RAR alpha-selective ligand used
	with an RXR-selective ligand generated the same responses as did
	all-trans RA or 9-cis RA, which affect both families of receptors,
	suggesting an important role for RAR alpha among RAR subtypes in
	eliciting cellular response. Consistent with this finding, the RAR
	alpha antagonist, Ro 41-5253, reduced the level of the cellular responses
	elicited by treatment with an RAR alpha-selective ligand plus RXR-selective
	ligand. The coupling of the shift of RB to its hypophosphorylated
	form with G1/0 arrest and differentiation in response to ligands
	is consistent with a possible role of RB as a downstream target or
	effector of RAR alpha and RXR in combination.},

	can be mimicked in vitro by phosphorylation of Sos by the mitogen-activated

@article{Burd2006,
	Abstract = {Cyclin D1 is a multifaceted regulator of both transcription and cell-cycle
	progression that exists in two distinct isoforms, cyclin D1a and
	D1b. In the prostate, cyclin D1a acts through discrete mechanisms
	to negatively regulate androgen receptor (AR) activity and thus limit
	androgen-dependent proliferation. Accordingly, cyclin D1a is rarely
	overexpressed in prostatic adenocarcinoma and holds little prognostic
	value in this tumor type. However, a common polymorphism (A870) known
	to facilitate production of cyclin D1b is associated with increased
	prostate cancer risk. Here we show that cyclin D1b is expressed at
	high frequency in prostate cancer and is up-regulated in neoplastic
	disease. Furthermore, our data demonstrate that, although cyclin
	D1b retains AR association, it is selectively compromised for AR
	regulation. The altered ability of cyclin D1b to regulate the AR
	was observed by using both in vitro and in vivo assays and was associated
	with compromised regulation of AR-dependent proliferation. Consistent
	with previous reports, expression of cyclin D1a inhibited cell-cycle
	progression in AR-dependent prostate cancer cells. Strikingly, cyclin
	D1b significantly stimulated proliferation in this cell type. AR-negative
	prostate cancer cells were nonresponsive to cyclin D1 (a or b) expression,
	indicating that defects in AR corepressor function yield a growth
	advantage specifically in AR-dependent cells. In summary, these studies
	indicate that the altered AR regulatory capacity of cyclin D1b contributes
	to its association with increased prostate cancer risk and provide
	evidence of cyclin D1b-mediated transcriptional regulation.},

	Trials Group to evaluate the efficacy and toxicity of two doses of
	oral gefitinib in patients with minimally symptomatic, hormone-refractory
	prostate cancer (HRPC). PATIENTS AND METHODS: Between July and November
	2001, 40 patients with HRPC and increasing prostate-specific antigen
	(PSA) or progression in measurable disease who had not received prior
	chemotherapy were randomly assigned to 250 mg (n = 19) or 500 mg
	(n = 21) oral gefitinib daily continuously. The primary end points
	were PSA response rate and objective measurable response. Functional
	Assessment of Cancer Therapy Prostate Cancer Subscale (FACT-P) quality-of-life
	questionnaires were completed at baseline and during treatment. RESULTS:
	None of the patients demonstrated a PSA or objective measurable response.
	Five (14.3\%) of 35 assessable patients had stable PSA (one patient
	at 250 mg and four patients at 500 mg), and five patients (14.3\%)
	had a best response of stable disease (duration, 2.5 to 16.8 months).
	No significant effect on the rate of increase in PSA was seen. The
	most common drug-related nonhematologic toxicities observed were
	grade 1 to 2 diarrhea (250 mg, 65\%; 500 mg, 56\%), fatigue (250
	mg, 29\%; 500 mg, 33\%), and grade 1 to 2 skin rash (250 mg, 24\%;
	500 mg, 39\%). FACT-P scores decreased during treatment, indicating
	worsening of symptoms compared with baseline. CONCLUSION: Gefitinib
	did not result in any responses in PSA or objective measurable disease
	at either dose level. Gefitinib has minimal single-agent activity

	Abstract = {Despite evidence implicating the insulin-like growth factor (IGF)
	system in the pathogenesis of prostate cancer, its precise role remains
	unclear. In this study we investigated the differential expression
	of IGF-I, IGF-II and their type I receptor (IGFR-I) in the epithelium
	and stroma of prostate neoplastic tissues. Using immunohistochemistry
	and in situ hybridization techniques, we analyzed 43 paraffin-embedded
	prostatic samples and compared prostatic cancer (Pca) with prostatic
	intraepithelial neoplasia (PIN) and its normal adjacent prostate
	(NAP) counterpart. We then determined a possible correlation of the
	immunohistochemical and in situ findings with two known prognostic
	clinical-pathological indices: Gleason score histological tumor grade
	and TNM clinical stage. In 22 of the 43 frozen prostatectomy specimens,
	IGF-I, IGF-II and IGFR-I mRNA expression were also evaluated by semiquantitative
	RT-PCR. Non neoplastic and neoplastic tissues examined contained
	detectable amounts of epithelial and stromal IGF-I, IGF-II and IGFR-I
	protein and mRNA; all levels increased significantly from normal
	tissue to PIN to Pca. In all three areas examined, IGFR-I expression
	was invariably higher in epithelium than in stroma, whereas expression
	of IGF ligands differed. In normal prostatic tissue, IGF-I and IGF-II
	expression was higher in stroma than in epithelium. Conversely, in
	Pca tissue, both factors were more strongly expressed in epithelial
	malignant cells. PIN areas showed IGF-I lowest, and IGF-II and IGFR-I
	levels highest in the epithelium. IGF-II protein and mRNA reached
	their highest levels in prostate tumors with high Gleason scores.
	These findings indicate that the IGF system changes as prostate tissue
	progresses from a normal to a malignant state. Differential expression
	of certain IGF system components in Pca may be associated with the
	malignant phenotype and more aggressive tumor behavior. Hence IGFs
	could serve to predict the outcome of prostatic cancer.},

	Abstract = {Among the topoisomerase (topo) II isozymes (alpha and beta), topo
	IIbeta has been suggested to regulate differentiation. In this study,
	we examined the role of topo IIbeta in all-trans retinoic acid (ATRA)-induced
	differentiation of myeloid leukemia cell lines. Inhibition of topo
	IIbeta activity or downregulation of protein expression enhanced
	ATRA-induced differentiation/growth arrest and apoptosis. ATRA-induced
	apoptosis in topo IIbeta-deficient cells involved activation of the
	caspase cascade and was rescued by ectopic expression of topo IIbeta.
	Gene expression profiling led to the identification of peroxiredoxin
	2 (PRDX2) as a candidate gene that was downregulated in topo IIbeta-deficient
	cells. Reduced expression of PRDX2 validated at the mRNA and protein
	level, in topo IIbeta-deficient cells correlated with increased accumulation
	of reactive oxygen species (ROS) following ATRA-induced differentiation.
	Overexpression of PRDX2 in topo IIbeta-deficient cells led to reduced
	accumulation of ROS and partially reversed ATRA-induced apoptosis.
	These results support a role for topo IIbeta in survival of ATRA-differentiated
	myeloid leukemia cells. Reduced expression of topo IIbeta induces
	apoptosis in part by impairing the anti-oxidant capacity of the cell
	owing to downregulation of PRDX2. Thus, suppression of topo IIbeta
	and/or PRDX2 levels in myeloid leukemia cells provides a novel approach
	for improving ATRA-based differentiation therapy.},

	Abstract = {Raf kinase is a key component in regulating the MAPK pathway. B-Raf
	has been reported as an oncogene and is mutated in 60\% of human
	melanomas. The main focus of Raf regulation studies has been on phosphorylation,
	dephosphorylation, and scaffolding proteins; however, Raf also has
	its own auto-regulatory domain. Removal of the N-terminal regulatory
	domain, initially discovered in the viral Raf oncogene (v-Raf), results
	in a kinase domain with high basal activity independent of Ras activation.
	In this report, we show that activating phosphorylations are still
	required for activity of the truncated C-terminal kinase domain (called
	22W). The interaction between the N-terminal regulatory domain and
	the C-terminal kinase domain is disrupted by activated Ras. Mutations
	in the Ras binding domain, cysteine-rich domain, or S259A do not
	affect the inhibition of 22W by the N-terminal domain. When phosphomimetic
	residues are substituted at the activating sites (DDED) in 22W, this
	results in a higher basal activity that is no longer inhibited by
	expression of the N-terminal domain, although binding to the N-terminal
	domain still occurs. Although the interaction between 22W/DDED and
	the N-terminal domain may be in a different conformation, the interaction
	is still disrupted by activated Ras. These data demonstrate that
	N-terminal domain binding to the kinase domain inhibits the activity
	of the kinase domain. However, this inhibition is relieved when the
	C-terminal kinase domain is activated by phosphorylation.},

	In this report, we demonstrate that Raf-1 associated with the SH2

	with the SH2 domains of phospholipase C-gamma 1, the p85 alpha subunit
	of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase, and SH2-containing protein tyrosine

	retinoic acid (ATRA) stimulated differentiation in the leukemic cell
	line HL-60. It promotes induced myeloid maturation when overexpressed,
	whereas knocking it down is inhibitory. It is a type II membrane
	protein with an extracellular C-terminal enzymatic domain with NADase/NADPase
	and ADPR cyclase activity and a short cytoplasmic N-terminal tail.
	Here we determined whether CD38 enzymatic activity or the cytoplasmic
	tail is required for ATRA-induced differentiation. Neither a specific
	CD38 ectoenzyme inhibitor nor a point mutation that cripples enzymatic
	activity (CD38 E226Q) diminishes ATRA-induced differentiation or
	G1/0 arrest. In contrast a cytosolic deletion mutation (CD38 ?11-20)
	prevents membrane expression and inhibits differentiation and G1/0
	arrest. These results may be consistent with disrupting the function
	of critical molecules necessary for membrane-expressed CD38 signal
	transduction. One candidate molecule is the Src family kinase Fgr,
	which failed to undergo ATRA-induced upregulation in CD38 ?11-20
	expressing cells. Another is Vav1, which also showed only basal expression
	after ATRA treatment in CD38 ?11-20 expressing cells. Therefore,
	the ability of CD38 to propel ATRA-induced myeloid differentiation
	and G1/0 arrest is unimpaired by loss of its ectoenzyme activity.
	However a cytosolic tail deletion mutation disrupted membrane localization
	and inhibited differentiation. ATRA-induced differentiation thus
	does not require the CD38 ectoenzyme function, but is dependent on
	a membrane receptor function.},

	Abstract = {Prostate cancers require androgen for growth but progress to an androgen-independent
	stage under the selective pressure of androgen ablation therapy.
	Here we describe a novel human prostate cancer xenograft (LAPC-9)
	propagated by serial passage in male severe combined immunodeficient
	mice that expresses prostate-specific antigen and wild-type androgen
	receptor. In response to castration, LAPC-9 cells undergo growth
	arrest and persist in a dormant, androgen-responsive state for at
	least 6 months. After prolonged periods of androgen deprivation,
	spontaneous androgen-independent outgrowths develop. Thus, prostate
	cancers progress to androgen independence through two distinct stages,
	initially escaping dependence on androgen for survival and, subsequently,
	for growth. Through the use of serial dilution and fluctuation analysis,
	we provide evidence that the latter stage of androgen independence
	results from clonal expansion of androgen-independent cells that
	are present at a frequency of about 1 per 10(5)-10(6) androgen-dependent
	cells. We conclude that prostate cancers contain heterogeneous mixtures
	of cells that vary in their dependence on androgen for growth and
	survival and that treatment with antiandrogen therapy provides selective
	pressure and alters the relative frequency of these cells, thereby
	leading to outgrowths of androgen-independent cancers.},

	Abstract = {Aberrant activation of the androgen receptor (AR) may be one of the
	mechanisms which contribute to progression of prostatic carcinoma
	to an androgen-independent stage. We investigated effects of growth
	factors on stimulation of the AR-mediated gene transcription in human
	prostatic tumor cell lines. DU-145 cells, which do not contain endogenous
	AR, were cotransfected with an androgen-inducible chloramphenicol
	acetyltransferase (CAT) reporter gene and an AR expression vector.
	The reporter gene (CAT) was driven either by artificial promoters
	consisting of one or two androgen-responsive elements in front of
	a TATA box or by the promoter of the prostate-specific antigen (PSA)
	gene, a naturally occurring androgen-inducible promoter. Insulin-like
	growth factor-I (IGF-I), at a concentration of 50 ng/ml, stimulated
	AR-mediated reporter gene transcription to the same extent as the
	synthetic androgen methyltrienolone. This growth factor was effective
	irrespective of the nature of the androgen-inducible promoter. Keratinocyte
	growth factor (KGF) and epidermal growth factor (EGF), at concentrations
	of 50 ng/ml, activated CAT reporter gene transcription only in experiments
	in which the artificial promoter with two androgen-responsive elements
	was used. Insulin-like growth factor-II and basic fibroblast growth
	factor displayed no effect on AR-mediated gene transcription. None
	of the growth factors stimulated reporter gene activity in control
	experiments when added to cells cotransfected with the CAT gene and
	an empty expression vector. AR activation by IGF-I, KGF, and EGF
	was completely inhibited by the pure AR antagonist casodex, showing
	that these effects are AR mediated. Activation of endogenous AR by
	growth factors was studied in the LNCaP cell line by determination
	of PSA secretion. IGF-I, at a concentration of 50 ng/ml, increased
	the PSA level in the supernatant of this cell line 5-fold. Again,
	the IGF-I effect on PSA secretion was blocked by casodex. Our results
	provide evidence that IGF-I, KGF, and EGF directly activate the AR
	in the absence of androgens, which means that the androgen-signaling
	chain may be activated by growth factors in an androgen-depleted
	environment. These findings may have implications for endocrine therapy

	Abstract = {The Raf-1 protein kinase is a major activator of the ERK MAPK pathway,
	which links signaling by a variety of cell surface receptors to the
	regulation of cell proliferation, survival, differentiation and migration.
	Signaling by Raf-1 is regulated by a complex and poorly understood
	interplay between phosphorylation events and protein-protein interactions.
	One important mode of Raf-1 regulation involves the phosphorylation-dependent
	binding of 14-3-3 proteins. Here, we have examined the mechanism
	whereby the C-terminal 14-3-3 binding site of Raf-1, S621, controls
	the activation of MEK-ERK signaling. We show that phosphorylation
	of S621 turns over rapidly and is enriched in the activated pool
	of endogenous Raf-1. The phosphorylation on this site can be mediated
	by Raf-1 itself but also by other kinase(s). Mutations that prevent
	the binding of 14-3-3 proteins to S621 render Raf-1 inactive by specifically
	disrupting its capacity to bind to ATP, and not by gross conformational
	alteration as indicated by intact MEK binding. Phosphorylation of
	S621 correlates with the inhibition of Raf-1 catalytic activity in
	vitro, but 14-3-3 proteins can completely reverse this inhibition.
	Our findings suggest that 14-3-3 proteins function as critical cofactors
	in Raf-1 activation, which induce and maintain the protein in a state
	that is competent for both ATP binding and MEK phosphorylation.},

@article{Eardley1994,
	Abstract = {With the recent pressure to control health care expenditures, the
	costs of patient participation in clinical trials, especially in
	their earliest phases, have come under increasingly intense scrutiny.
	We therefore reviewed our experience in patients with acute promyelocytic
	leukemia (APL) who were treated during the first US trial of a new
	experimental drug, all-trans retinoic acid (RA). The purpose of the
	review was to evaluate parameters of patient morbidity and financial
	cost associated with the use of all-trans RA compared with standard
	chemotherapy for induction of complete remission in newly-diagnosed
	patients with APL. We retrospectively compared outcomes of consecutive
	patients treated during the first 2 years of our studies that used
	all-trans RA for remission induction (1990-1992) with an identical
	number of patients consecutively treated with standard chemotherapy
	(cytosine arabinoside plus an anthracycline) during the immediately
	preceding period (1985-1990). Responding patients in both groups
	received post-remission chemotherapy. Evaluation parameters included
	transfusions of packed red blood cells and platelets, use of anti-bacterial
	and anti-fungal drugs, duration of fever, time to remission, length
	of hospital stay, hospital charges, and both overall and relapse-free
	survival. Thirty patients were evaluated in each group. Complete
	remission was achieved in 26 patients (87\%) treated with all-trans
	RA, and 24 patients (77\%) treated with chemotherapy (p = 0.5). In
	the chemotherapy group, there were five early deaths (four from hemorrhage,
	one from sepsis); one other patient was resistant to treatment and
	died at 6 months. Four patients in the all-trans RA group died prior
	to response from complications of the 'retinoic acid syndrome'. The
	median time to complete response by all criteria was 41 days (range,
	18-78) for the all-trans RA group and 50 days (range, 24-121) for
	patients who received conventional chemotherapy (p = 0.2). Looking
	only at patients who achieved remission, chemotherapy-treated patients
	required a significantly greater number of platelet transfusions
	(medians, 14 vs. 4; p < 0.001) and packed red blood cell transfusions
	(15 vs. 4; p < 0.001). Patients who received chemotherapy also experienced
	a significantly larger number of days with fever (13 vs. 6; p = 0.01)
	that was reflected in a greater median number of days on combination
	antibiotics (35 vs. 21; p = 0.001) and Amphotericin B (20 vs. 0;
	p < 0.001).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)},

@article{Eisenberger1998,
	Abstract = {BACKGROUND: Combined androgen blockade for the treatment of metastatic
	prostate cancer consists of an antiandrogen drug plus castration.
	In a previous trial, we found that adding the antiandrogen flutamide
	to leuprolide acetate (a synthetic gonadotropin-releasing hormone
	that results in medical ablation of testicular function) significantly
	improved survival as compared with that achieved with placebo plus
	leuprolide acetate. In the current trial, we compared flutamide plus
	bilateral orchiectomy with placebo plus orchiectomy. METHODS: We
	randomly assigned patients who had never received antiandrogen therapy
	and who had distant metastases from adenocarcinoma of the prostate
	to treatment with bilateral orchiectomy and either flutamide or placebo.
	Patients were stratified according to the extent of disease and according
	to performance status. RESULTS: Of the 1387 patients who were enrolled
	in the trial, 700 were randomly assigned to the flutamide group and
	687 to the placebo group. Overall, the incidence of toxic effects
	was minimal; the only notable differences between the groups were
	the greater rates of diarrhea and anemia with flutamide. There was
	no significant difference between the two groups in overall survival
	(P=0.14). The estimated risk of death (hazard ratio) for flutamide
	as compared with placebo was 0.91 (90 percent confidence interval,
	0.81 to 1.01). Flutamide was not associated with enhanced benefit
	in patients with minimal disease. CONCLUSIONS: The addition of flutamide
	to bilateral orchiectomy does not result in a clinically meaningful
	improvement in survival among patients with metastatic prostate cancer.},

	(mEGF), human EGF (hEGF), and transforming growth factor alpha (TGF

	at pH 7.4. However, the binding properties of these ligands have
	substantially different pH sensitivities resulting in varying degrees

	B82 fibroblasts. mEGF, hEGF, and TGF alpha display significantly
	different steady-state endosomal sorting patterns which correspond
	to the extent of their dissociation at endosomal pH. Moreover, several
	recombinant hEGF mutants with differing affinities exhibit altered
	endosomal sorting compared to hEGF, demonstrating a similar direct
	relationship between ligand binding properties and endosomal sorting
	outcomes. Intracellular trafficking of the EGF ligands was also monitored
	by measuring the observed degradation rate constants. These likewise

	Abstract = {PURPOSE: To investigate the pharmacokinetics of arsenic species in
	Japanese patients with relapsed or refractory acute promyelocytic
	leukemia (APL) treated with arsenic trioxide (ATO) at a daily dose
	of 0.15 mg/kg. METHODS: Inorganic arsenic (AsIII and AsV) and the
	major metabolites monomethylarsonic acid (MAA(V)) and dimethylarsinic
	acid (DMAA(V)) in plasma and urine collected from 12 Japanese patients
	were quantified by HPLC/ICP-MS. RESULTS: The plasma concentrations
	of AsIII and AsV on day 1 reached the similar Cmax (12.4 +/- 8.4
	and 10.2 +/- 3.9 ng/ml) immediately after completion of administration
	followed by a biphasic elimination. The AUC(0-infinity) of AsV was
	about twice that of AsIII. The appearance of methylated metabolites
	in the blood was delayed. During the repeated administration, the
	plasma concentrations of inorganic arsenic reached the steady state.
	In contrast, the MAA(V) and DMAA(V) concentrations increased in relation
	to increased administration frequency. The mean total arsenic excretion
	rate including inorganic arsenic and methylated arsenic was about
	20\% of daily dose on day 1 and remained at about 60\% of daily dose
	during week 1-4. CONCLUSIONS: This study demonstrates that ATO is
	metabolized when administered intravenously to APL patients and methylated
	metabolites are promptly eliminated from the blood and excreted into
	urine after completion of administration, indicating no measurable
	accumulation of ATO in the blood.},

	Abstract = {Androgen independence is responsible for most prostate cancer lethality,
	yet currently there are no effective clinical treatments. We have
	been investigating the mechanisms underlying androgen-independent
	prostate cancer in Nkx3.1;Pten mutant mice, which display salient
	features of the disease, including a requirement for wild-type androgen
	receptor (AR) signaling. We now demonstrate that the Akt and Erk
	MAP kinase signaling pathways are activated in androgen-independent
	lesions of these mice. Forced activation of either Akt or Erk signaling
	in an androgen-responsive prostate cancer cell line promotes hormone-independent
	but AR-dependent growth in culture. Although these pathways act additively
	in culture, they act synergistically in vivo to promote tumorigenicity
	and androgen independence in the context of the prostate microenvironment.
	We propose that androgen independence emerges by means of epithelial-stromal
	competition, in which activation of Akt and Erk promotes AR activity
	in the prostate epithelium while counteracting antagonistic effects
	of the stroma.},

	Abstract = {Androgen receptor (AR) is a member of the steroid hormone receptor
	family of molecules. AR primarily is responsible for mediating the
	physiologic effects of androgens by binding to specific DNA sequences
	that influence transcription of androgen-responsive genes. The three-dimensional
	structure of the AR ligand-binding domain has shown it is similar
	to other steroid hormone receptors and that ligand binding alters
	the protein conformation to allow binding of coactivator molecules
	that amplify the hormone signal and mediate transcriptional initiation.
	However, AR also undergoes intramolecular interactions that regulate
	its interactions with coactivators and influence its activity. A
	large number of naturally occurring mutations of the human AR gene
	have provided important information about AR molecular structure
	and intermolecular interactions. AR is also a critical mediator of
	prostate cancer promotion, conferring growth signals to prostate
	cancer cells throughout the natural history of the disease. Late-stage
	prostate cancer, unresponsive to hormonal deprivation, sustains AR
	signaling through a diverse array of molecular strategies. Variations
	in the AR gene may also confer genetic predisposition to prostate
	cancer development and severity. Further understanding of AR action
	and new strategies to interfere with AR signaling hold promise for
	improving prostate cancer therapy.},

	Abstract = {Oxidative burst, a critical antimicrobial mechanism of neutrophils,
	involves the rapid generation and release of reactive oxygen intermediates
	(ROIs) by the NADPH oxidase complex. Genetic mutations in an NADPH
	oxidase subunit, gp91 (also referred to as NOX2), are associated
	with chronic granulomatous disease (CGD), which is characterized
	by recurrent and life-threatening microbial infections. To combat
	such infections, ROIs are produced by neutrophils after stimulation
	by integrin-dependent adhesion to the ECM in conjunction with stimulation
	from inflammatory mediators, or microbial components containing pathogen-associated
	molecular patterns. In this report, we provide genetic evidence that
	both the Vav family of Rho GTPase guanine nucleotide exchange factors
	(GEFs) and phospholipase C-gamma2 (PLC-gamma2) are critical mediators
	of adhesion-dependent ROI production by neutrophils in mice. We also
	demonstrated that Vav was critically required for neutrophil-dependent
	host defense against systemic infection by Staphylococcus aureus
	and Pseudomonas aeruginosa, 2 common pathogens associated with fatal
	cases of hospital-acquired pneumonia. We identified a molecular pathway
	in which Vav GEFs linked integrin-mediated signaling with PLC-gamma2
	activation, release of intracellular Ca2+ cations, and generation
	of diacylglycerol to control assembly of the NADPH oxidase complex
	and ROI production by neutrophils. Taken together, our data indicate
	that integrin-dependent signals generated during neutrophil adhesion
	contribute to the activation of NADPH oxidase by a variety of distinct
	effector pathways, all of which require Vav.},

	Abstract = {Quantitative computational models play an increasingly important role
	in modern biology. Such models typically involve many free parameters,
	and assigning their values is often a substantial obstacle to model
	development. Directly measuring in vivo biochemical parameters is
	difficult, and collectively fitting them to other experimental data
	often yields large parameter uncertainties. Nevertheless, in earlier
	work we showed in a growth-factor-signaling model that collective
	fitting could yield well-constrained predictions, even when it left
	individual parameters very poorly constrained. We also showed that
	the model had a "sloppy" spectrum of parameter sensitivities, with
	eigenvalues roughly evenly distributed over many decades. Here we
	use a collection of models from the literature to test whether such
	sloppy spectra are common in systems biology. Strikingly, we find
	that every model we examine has a sloppy spectrum of sensitivities.
	We also test several consequences of this sloppiness for building
	predictive models. In particular, sloppiness suggests that collective
	fits to even large amounts of ideal time-series data will often leave
	many parameters poorly constrained. Tests over our model collection
	are consistent with this suggestion. This difficulty with collective
	fits may seem to argue for direct parameter measurements, but sloppiness
	also implies that such measurements must be formidably precise and
	complete to usefully constrain many model predictions. We confirm
	this implication in our growth-factor-signaling model. Our results
	suggest that sloppy sensitivity spectra are universal in systems
	biology models. The prevalence of sloppiness highlights the power
	of collective fits and suggests that modelers should focus on predictions
	rather than on parameters.},

	Abstract = {ErbB tyrosine kinase receptors mediate mitogenic signal cascade by
	binding a variety of ligands and recruiting the different cassettes
	of adaptor proteins. In the present study, we examined heregulin
	(HRG)-induced signal transduction of ErbB4 receptor and found that
	the phosphatidylinositol 3'-kinase (PI3K)-Akt pathway negatively
	regulated the extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) cascade
	by phosphorylating Raf-1 on Ser(259). As the time-course kinetics
	of Akt and ERK activities seemed to be transient and complex, we
	constructed a mathematical simulation model for HRG-induced ErbB4
	receptor signalling to explain the dynamics of the regulation mechanism
	in this signal transduction cascade. The model reflected well the
	experimental results observed in HRG-induced ErbB4 cells and in other
	modes of growth hormone-induced cell signalling that involve Raf-Akt
	cross-talk. The model suggested that HRG signalling is regulated
	by protein phosphatase 2A as well as Raf-Akt cross-talk, and protein
	phosphatase 2A modulates the kinase activity in both the PI3K-Akt
	and MAPK (mitogen-activated protein kinase) pathways.},

	Abstract = {The normal development and maintenance of the prostate is dependent
	on androgen acting through the androgen receptor (AR). AR remains
	important in the development and progression of prostate cancer.
	AR expression is maintained throughout prostate cancer progression,
	and the majority of androgen-independent or hormone refractory prostate
	cancers express AR. Mutation of AR, especially mutations that result
	in a relaxation of AR ligand specificity, may contribute to the progression
	of prostate cancer and the failure of endocrine therapy by allowing
	AR transcriptional activation in response to antiandrogens or other
	endogenous hormones. Similarly, alterations in the relative expression
	of AR coregulators have been found to occur with prostate cancer
	progression and may contribute to differences in AR ligand specificity
	or transcriptional activity. Prostate cancer progression is also
	associated with increased growth factor production and an altered
	response to growth factors by prostate cancer cells. The kinase signal
	transduction cascades initiated by mitogenic growth factors modulate
	the transcriptional activity of AR and the interaction between AR
	and AR coactivators. The inhibition of AR activity through mechanisms
	in addition to androgen ablation, such as modulation of signal transduction
	pathways, may delay prostate cancer progression.},

	Abstract = {Phosphorylation events play a crucial role in Raf activation. Phosphorylation
	of serines 259 and 621 in C-Raf and serines 364 and 728 in B-Raf
	has been suggested to be critical for association with 14-3-3 proteins.
	To study the functional consequences of Raf phosphorylations at these
	positions, we developed and characterized phosphospecific antibodies
	directed against 14-3-3 binding epitopes: a monoclonal phosphospecific
	antibody (6B4) directed against pS621 and a polyclonal antibody specific
	for B-Raf-pS364 epitope. Although 6B4 detected both C- and B-Raf
	in Western blots, it specifically recognizes the native form of C-Raf
	but not B-Raf. Contrary to B-Raf, a kinase-dead mutant of C-Raf was
	found to be only poorly phosphorylated in the Ser-621 position. Moreover,
	serine 259 to alanine mutation prevented the Ser-621 phosphorylation
	suggesting an interdependence between these two 14-3-3 binding domains.
	Direct C-Raf.14-3-3 binding studies with purified proteins combined
	with competition assays revealed that the 14-3-3 binding domain surrounding
	pS621 represents the high affinity binding site, whereas the pS259
	epitope mediates lower affinity binding. Raf isozymes differ in their
	14-3-3 association rates. The time course of endogenous C-Raf activation
	in mammalian cells by nerve growth factor (NGF) has been examined
	using both phosphospecific antibodies directed against 14-3-3 binding
	sites (6B4 and anti-pS259) as well as phosphospecific antibodies
	directed against the activation domain (anti-pS338 and anti-pY340/pY341).
	Time course of Ser-621 phosphorylation, in contrast to Ser-259 phosphorylation,
	exhibited unexpected pattern reaching maximal phosphorylation within
	30 s of NGF stimulation. Phosphorylation of tyrosine 340/341 reached
	maximal levels subsequent to Ser-621 phosphorylation and was coincident
	with emergence of kinase activity. Taken together, we found substantial
	differences between C-Raf.14-3-3 binding epitopes pS259 and pS621
	and visualized for the first time the sequence of the essential C-Raf

	Abstract = {Retinoic acid (RA) is known to cause the myeloid differentiation of
	HL-60 human myeloblastic leukemia cells in a process requiring MEK-dependent
	ERK2 activation. This RA-induced ERK2 activation appears after approximately
	4 h and persists until the cells are differentiated and G0 arrested
	(Yen et al, 1998). This motivates the question of whether RA also
	activated RAF as part of a typical RAF/MEK/MAPK cascade. Retinoic
	acid is shown here to also increase the phosphorylation of RAF, but
	in an unusual way. Surprisingly, increased RAF phosphorylation is
	first detectable after 12 to 24 hours by phosphorylation-induced
	retardation of polyacrylamide gel electrophoretic mobility. The RA-induced
	increased RAF phosphorylation is still apparent after 72 hours of
	treatment when most cells are differentiated and G0 arrested. There
	is a progressive dose-response relationship with 10(-8), 10(-7),
	and 10(-6) M RA. The RA-induced RAF phosphorylation corresponds to
	increased in vitro kinase activity. Inhibition of MEK with a PD98059
	dose which inhibits ERK2 phosphorylation and subsequent cell differentiation
	also inhibits RAF phosphorylation. RA-induced MEK-dependent RAF phosphorylation
	is not due to changes in the amount of cellular MEK. The induced
	RAF phosphorylation, as well as anteceding ERK2 activation, depends
	on ligand-induced activation of both an RARalpha receptor and an
	RXR receptor. This and the slow kinetics of activation suggest a
	need for prior RA-induced gene expression. In summary, RA induces
	a MEK-dependent prolonged RAF activation, whose slow onset occurs
	after ERK2 activation but still well before cell cycle arrest and
	cell differentiation. The RA-induced increased RAF phosphorylation
	thus differs from typical mitogenic growth factor signaling, features
	that may contribute to cell cycle arrest and differentiation instead
	of division as the cellular outcome.},

	Abstract = {Androgen receptor (AR)-associated coregulator 70 (ARA70) was the first
	identified AR coregulator. However, its molecular mechanism and biological
	relevance to prostate cancer remain unclear. Here we show that ARA70
	interacts with and promotes AR activity via the consensus FXXLF motif
	within the ARA70-N2 domain (amino acids 176-401). However, it does
	not promote AR activity via the classic LXXLL motif located at amino
	acids 92-96, although this classic LXXLL motif is important for ARA70
	to interact with other receptors, such as PPARgamma. The molecular
	mechanisms by which ARA70 enhances AR transactivation involve the
	increase of AR expression, protein stability, and nuclear translocation.
	Furthermore, ARA70 protein is more frequently detected in prostate
	cancer specimens (91.74%) than in benign tissues (64.64%, p < 0.0001).
	ARA70 expression is also increased in high-grade prostate cancer
	tissues as well as the hormone-refractory LNCaP xenografts and prostate
	cancer cell lines. Because ARA70 can promote the antiandrogen hydroxyflutamide
	(HF)-enhanced AR transactivation, the increased ARA70 expression
	in hormone-refractory prostate tumors may confer the development
	of HF withdrawal syndrome, commonly diagnosed in patients with the
	later stages of prostate cancer. Because ARA70-N2 containing the
	AR-interacting FXXLF motif without coactivation function can suppress
	HF-enhanced AR transactivation in the hormone-refractory LNCaP cells,
	using the ARA70-N2 inhibitory peptide at the hormone refractory stage
	to battle the HF withdrawal syndrome may become an alternative strategy
	to treat prostate cancer.},

	Abstract = {The mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) cascade is a highly conserved
	series of three protein kinases implicated in diverse biological
	processes. Here we demonstrate that the cascade arrangement has unexpected
	consequences for the dynamics of MAPK signaling. We solved the rate
	equations for the cascade numerically and found that MAPK is predicted
	to behave like a highly cooperative enzyme, even though it was not
	assumed that any of the enzymes in the cascade were regulated cooperatively.
	Measurements of MAPK activation in Xenopus oocyte extracts confirmed
	this prediction. The stimulus/response curve of the MAPK was found
	to be as steep as that of a cooperative enzyme with a Hill coefficient
	of 4-5, well in excess of that of the classical allosteric protein
	hemoglobin. The shape of the MAPK stimulus/ response curve may make
	the cascade particularly appropriate for mediating processes like
	mitogenesis, cell fate induction, and oocyte maturation, where a
	cell switches from one discrete state to another.},

	Abstract = {BACKGROUND: The acquisition of an androgen-independent phenotype is
	the most serious issue of prostate cancer treatment. Although several
	experimental cell models have been reported for studying androgen
	independence, they have limited applications related to hormone-refractory
	prostate cancer. To investigate the molecular mechanism of androgen-independent
	growth of prostate cancer, we established a useful LNCaP cell model
	that resembles the clinical scenario of hormone-refractory prostate
	cancer. METHODS: Androgen-sensitive LNCaP parental cells were continuously
	maintained in a regular cell-culture medium, that is, phenol red-positive
	RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 5\% fetal bovine serum and 1\%
	glutamine. Upon passage, the androgen responsiveness of those cells
	decreased, to a level lower than that of parental cells. We examined
	the growth properties and androgen responsiveness of these different
	LNCaP cells in vitro and in vivo. Cytogenetic characteristics and
	expression of androgen receptors (ARs) and prostate-specific antigen
	(PSA) were determined. RESULTS: Upon continuous passage, the biological
	behavior of parental C-33 cells (passage number less than 33) was
	altered. C-81 cells (passage number higher than 81) clearly exhibited
	more aggressive growth and lower androgen responsiveness than C-33
	and C-51 cells (passage number between 35 and 80) in vitro and in
	vivo. Nevertheless, all these cells expressed a similar level of
	functional AR protein as well as a similar genetic profile. Moreover,
	in a steroid-reduced culture condition, C-81 cells secreted a higher
	level of PSA than C-33 cells. CONCLUSIONS: Our LNCaP cell model closely
	recapitulates the progression of human prostate cancer from the androgen-responsive
	to the hormone-refractory state under the androgen nondeprived condition.
	This cell model may provide the opportunity to understand the molecular
	mechanisms associated with the acquisition of androgen independence
	during human prostate cancer progression.},

@article{Igawa2003,
	Abstract = {BACKGROUND: Although the molecular mechanism of androgen-independent
	prostate cancer growth and progression has been gradually elucidated,
	there is limited effective treatment for this prevalent disease.
	Human prostatic acid phosphatase (PAcP), a major protein tyrosine
	phosphatase in prostate epithelium, plays a critical role in regulating
	the growth of prostate cancer cells. In prostate carcinomas, the
	expression of cellular PAcP decreases. To explore directly the possible
	therapeutic potential of cellular PAcP, we investigated the suppression
	effect of PAcP by utilizing cDNA direct intratumoral administration
	in androgen-independent LNCaP xenograft tumors. METHODS: An androgen-independent
	LNCaP cell model (C-33 and C-81 cells) and stable subclones of PAcP
	cDNA-transfected C-81 cells (LNCaP-23 and LNCaP-34 cells) were used
	for the experiments. We examined the growth property and expression
	of PAcP and c-ErbB-2 of these different LNCaP cells in vitro and
	in vivo. We subsequently investigated the growth suppression effect
	of PAcP cDNA intratumoral injection in pre-established C-81 xenograft
	tumors, and analyzed the expression of PAcP, prostate-specific antigen
	(PSA), proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA), and c-ErbB-2 in
	the tumors by immunohistochemistry and Western blotting. RESULTS:
	The different LNCaP cells exhibited different growth property and
	tumorigenicity, both in cell culture and xenograft. Biochemical characterizations
	revealed that the level of cellular PAcP correlated negatively with
	the growth property of different LNCaP cells, while the level of
	tyrophosphorylated c-ErbB-2 had an inverse correlation with cellular
	PAcP. The single intratumoral administration of the wild type PAcP
	cDNA showed a significant suppression effect on C-81 xenograft tumor
	growth, compared to vector alone-injected control (P<0.05). In the
	tumors injected with this PAcP cDNA, the PAcP expression was detected
	1 week (wk) after injection, but was undetectable at 6 wk, which
	inversely correlated with the level of tyrophosphorylated c-ErbB-2
	and the degree of cell proliferation indicated by PCNA staining.
	CONCLUSIONS: Our results clearly demonstrated that cellular PAcP
	has a suppression effect on the growth of androgen-independent LNCaP
	xenograft tumors. This effect occurs at least partly through the
	dephosphorylation of c-ErbB-2 by PAcP, the prostate-specific protein
	tyrosine phosphatase. The data indicates that human PAcP could be
	utilized in the corrective gene therapy for a subgroup of androgen-independent
	human prostate cancer cells that lack cellular PAcP expression.},

	in the same endosomes through the fusion of endosomes containing

	monocytic differentiation of HL-60 cells. The increase of active
	Ras was observed at 24 hours after TPA stimulation and attained to
	threefold (15\%) over the proportion in nontreated HL-60 cells. Herbimycin
	A, an inhibitor of tyrosine kinase, prevented the activation of Ras,
	as well as the induction of monocytic differentiation. In parallel
	with the activation of Ras, the proteins with molecular weights of
	52, 56, 62, and 190 kD were tyrosine-phosphorylated and formed a
	complex with GTPase-activating protein (GAP) for Ras. In addition
	to the 116-kD GAP (type I GAP), the 100-kD GAP (type II GAP) molecule
	was markedly induced at 24 hours after TPA stimulation of HL-60 cells.
	These phenomena sustained for a further 24 hours during monocytic
	differentiation. However, they were not observed during retinoic

@article{Kholodenko1999,
	Abstract = {During the past decade, our knowledge of molecular mechanisms involved
	in growth factor signaling has proliferated almost explosively. However,
	the kinetics and control of information transfer through signaling
	networks remain poorly understood. This paper combines experimental
	kinetic analysis and computational modeling of the short term pattern
	of cellular responses to epidermal growth factor (EGF) in isolated
	hepatocytes. The experimental data show transient tyrosine phosphorylation
	of the EGF receptor (EGFR) and transient or sustained response patterns
	in multiple signaling proteins targeted by EGFR. Transient responses
	exhibit pronounced maxima, reached within 15-30 s of EGF stimulation
	and followed by a decline to relatively low (quasi-steady-state)
	levels. In contrast to earlier suggestions, we demonstrate that the
	experimentally observed transients can be accounted for without requiring
	receptor-mediated activation of specific tyrosine phosphatases, following
	EGF stimulation. The kinetic model predicts how the cellular response
	is controlled by the relative levels and activity states of signaling
	proteins and under what conditions activation patterns are transient
	or sustained. EGFR signaling patterns appear to be robust with respect
	to variations in many elemental rate constants within the range of
	experimentally measured values. On the other hand, we specify which
	changes in the kinetic scheme, rate constants, and total amounts
	of molecular factors involved are incompatible with the experimentally
	observed kinetics of signal transfer. Quantitation of signaling network
	responses to growth factors allows us to assess how cells process
	information controlling their growth and differentiation.},

	Abstract = {Expression of p21(Sdi1) downstream of p53 is essential for induction
	of cellular senescence, although cancer cell senescence can also
	occur in the p53 null condition. We report herein that senescence-associated
	phosphorylated extracellular signal-regulated protein kinases 1 and
	2 (SA-pErk1/2) enhanced p21(Sdi1) transcription by phosphorylating
	Sp1 on Ser(59) downstream of protein kinase C (PKC) alpha. Reactive
	oxygen species (ROS), which was increased in cellular senescence,
	significantly activated both PKCalpha and PKCbetaI. However, PKCalpha,
	but not PKCbetaI, regulated ROS generation and cell proliferation
	in senescent cells along with activation of cdk2, proven by siRNAs.
	PKCalpha-siRNA also reduced SA-pErk1/2 expression in old human diploid
	fibroblast cells, accompanied with changes of senescence phenotypes
	to young cell-like. Regulation of SA-pErk1/2 was also confirmed by
	using catalytically active PKCalpha and its DN-mutant construct.
	These findings strongly suggest a new pathway to regulate senescence
	phenotypes by ROS via Sp1 phosphorylation between PKCalpha and SA-pErk1/2:
	employing GST-Sp1 mutants and MEK inhibitor analyses, we found that
	SA-pErk1/2 regulated Sp1 phosphorylation on the Ser(59) residue in
	vivo, but not threonine, in cellular senescence, which regulated
	transcription of p21(Sdi1) expression. In summary, PKCalpha, which
	was activated in senescent cells by ROS strongly activated Erk1/2,
	and the SA-pErk1/2 in turn phosphorylated Sp1 on Ser(59). Sp1-enhanced
	transcription of p21(Sdi1) resulted in regulation of cellular senescence
	in primary human diploid fibroblast cells.},

@article{Kim2004,
	Abstract = {Prostate specific antigen (PSA) is a serine protease that is synthesized
	by both normal and malignant epithelial cells of the human prostate.
	PSA expressed by malignant cells, however, are released into the
	serum at an increased level, which can be detected to diagnose and
	monitor prostate cancer. Moreover, increases in serum PSA following
	local and systemic treatments are highly correlated with tumor recurrence
	and progression, and this association has further established PSA
	as a clinically important biomarker. The expression of PSA is mainly
	induced by androgens and regulated by the androgen receptor (AR)
	at the transcriptional level. Extensive research on the regulation
	of PSA gene expression has provided significant information about
	the function of AR, which is a crucial transcription factor involved
	in all phases of prostate cancer. Still, the molecular mechanism(s)
	by which the transcription of the PSA gene escapes regulation in
	advanced prostate cancer has yet to be clearly defined. Accumulating
	evidence suggests that a number of processes including androgen-independent
	activation of AR are involved. Lacking an effective treatment, advanced
	prostate cancer is almost invariably fatal, which highlights the
	importance of elucidating mechanisms of tumor progression. Insights
	into AR activity at the PSA gene could be extended to transcriptional
	regulation of other AR target genes, which may be crucial in discerning
	prostate cancer progression. Ultimately, our improved understanding
	of AR-regulated PSA expression could aid in developing viable therapies
	in treating and/or preventing advanced prostate cancer.},

	that the interspecies conservation of a given member of the RAR subfamily

	Inhibition of Ser-259 dephosphorylation has no effect on the activation
	of membrane-tethered Raf-1 (Raf-1CAAX). These data show that Ser-259

	prostatic hypertrophy, and 192 patients with prostate cancers at
	various stages as well as in 30 patients with cancers other than
	prostate cancer. Both markers were quantitated by specific sandwich-type,
	enzyme-linked, immunosorbent assays with the use of specific antiserum
	reagents. Serum assays revealed a discordance between these two markers;
	thus expressions of these two biochemically and immunologically distinct
	prostate-specific proteins may reflect different aspects in the biology
	of prostate cancer. A combination test with the use of 7.5 ng of
	prostate antigen and 15.5 ng of prostatic acid phosphatase/ml of
	serum, respectively, as cutoff values resulted in a positive detection
	rate of 58\% for prostate cancers of stages A (7/12) and B (21/36)
	each, 68\% for prostate cancer of stage C (19/28), 92\% for prostate
	cancer of stage D (106/116), and only 10\% for benign prostatic hypertrophy
	(3/29). None of 52 other cancers or healthy controls was registered
	as positive. This study demonstrates that a multiple marker test
	of tissue-specific antigens can be of an additive value in the immunodiagnosis
	of cancer and may be a logical and effective approach at this time,
	in light of the unavailability of human tumor-specific markers.},

	Abstract = {The expression and secretion of prostate-specific antigen (PSA) are
	regulated by androgens in normal prostate secretory epithelial cells.
	In prostate cancer patients, the serum PSA level is usually elevated
	and cancer cells are initially responsive to androgens. However,
	those cancer cells become androgen-independent after androgen ablation
	therapy. In hormone-refractory cancer patients, even in an androgen-deprived
	environment, the circulation level of PSA rebounds and is constitutively
	elevated through a yet unknown mechanism. Tyrosine phosphorylation
	of ErbB-2 is involved in regulating the androgen-responsive phenotype
	of prostate cancer cells, and it is at least partly regulated by
	the cellular form of prostatic acid phosphatase (PAcP), a prostate-unique
	protein tyrosine phosphatase. We investigated the ErbB-2 signal pathway
	in androgen-independent PSA secretion. LNCaP C-81 cells, which are
	androgen-independent LNCaP cells lacking endogenous PAcP expression
	with a hypertyrosine phosphorylated ErbB-2, secreted a higher level
	of PSA in conditioned media than did androgen-sensitive LNCaP C-33
	parental cells. A restored expression of cellular PAcP in C-81 cells
	was concurrent with a decrease in tyrophosphorylation of ErbB-2 and
	reduction of PSA secretion. Moreover, transient transfection of C-33
	cells with the wild-type ErbB-2 or a constitutively active mutant
	of MEK1 cDNA resulted in an increased level of secreted PSA. The
	elevation of secreted PSA level by the forced expression of ErbB-2
	was inhibited by an MEK inhibitor, PD98059. In C-81 cells, the expression
	of a dominant negative mutant of ErbB-2 reduced the secreted level
	of PSA. The inhibition of ErbB-2 or mitogen-activated protein (MAP)
	kinases by specific inhibitors AG879, AG825, or PD98059 led to a
	decrease in PSA secretion. Taken together, our data clearly indicate
	that the ErbB-2 signal pathway via MAP kinases (ERK1/2) is involved
	in regulating the secretion of PSA by androgen-independent human
	prostate cancer LNCaP C-81 cells in an androgen-depleted environment.},

	pathways have been used for exploring the dynamics and for detecting
	the key components of signaling pathways. METHODS: The authors previously
	developed a mathematic model of the epidermal growth factor receptor-extracellular
	signal-regulated protein kinase (EGFR-ERK) pathway using ordinary
	differential equations from existing EGFR-ERK pathway models. By
	using prolonged ERK activation as an indicator that may lead to cell
	proliferation under certain circumstances, in the current study,
	a pathway sensitivity analysis was performed to test its capability
	of detecting pro-proliferative activities through altered protein
	levels to examine the effects on ERK activation. RESULTS: The analysis
	revealed that 12 of 20 oncoproteins and 4 of 5 tumor suppressors
	were detected, consistent with reported experimental works. Because
	pathway dynamics depend on many factors, some of which were not included
	in the current models, failure to detect all known oncogenes and
	tumor suppressors can be because of the failure to include relevant
	crosstalk to other pathway components. CONCLUSIONS: Overall, the
	current results indicated that pathway sensitivity analysis is a
	useful approach for detecting and distinguishing pro-proliferation
	activities of oncoproteins and suppressed proliferative activities
	of tumor suppressors at altered protein levels at least in the EGFR-ERK
	model.},

	Abstract = {Mammalian glutamate dehydrogenase (GDH) is a homohexameric enzyme
	that catalyzes the reversible oxidative deamination of l-glutamate
	to 2-oxoglutarate using NAD(P)(+) as coenzyme. Unlike its counterparts
	from other animal kingdoms, mammalian GDH is regulated by a host
	of ligands. The recently discovered hyperinsulinism/hyperammonemia
	disorder showed that the loss of allosteric inhibition of GDH by
	GTP causes excessive secretion of insulin. Subsequent studies demonstrated
	that wild-type and hyperinsulinemia/hyperammonemia forms of GDH are
	inhibited by the green tea polyphenols, epigallocatechin gallate
	and epicatechin gallate. This was followed by high throughput studies
	that identified more stable inhibitors, including hexachlorophene,
	GW5074, and bithionol. Shown here are the structures of GDH complexed
	with these three compounds. Hexachlorophene forms a ring around the
	internal cavity in GDH through aromatic stacking interactions between
	the drug and GDH as well as between the drug molecules themselves.
	In contrast, GW5074 and bithionol both bind as pairs of stacked compounds
	at hexameric 2-fold axes between the dimers of subunits. The internal
	core of GDH contracts when the catalytic cleft closes during enzymatic
	turnover. None of the drugs cause conformational changes in the contact
	residues, but all bind to key interfaces involved in this contraction
	process. Therefore, it seems likely that the drugs inhibit enzymatic
	turnover by inhibiting this transition. Indeed, this expansion/contraction
	process may play a major role in the inter-subunit communication
	and allosteric regulation observed in GDH.},

	the neuronal differentiation of ES cells. Cultured mouse ES cells
	were treated with an all-trans-retinoic-acid (RA) protocol to generate

	Abstract = {Androgen plays a critical role in regulating the growth and differentiation
	of normal prostate epithelia, as well as the initial growth of prostate
	cancer cells. Nevertheless, prostate carcinomas eventually become
	androgen-unresponsive, and the cancer is refractory to hormonal therapy.
	To gain insight into the mechanism involved in this hormone-refractory
	phenomenon, we have examined the potential role of the androgen receptor
	(AR) in that process. We have investigated the expression of AR and
	two prostate-specific androgen-responsive antigens, prostatic acid
	phosphatase (PAcP) and prostate-specific antigen (PSA), for the functional
	activity of AR in LNCaP and PC-3 human prostate carcinoma cells.
	Our results are as follows. (i) Clone 33 LNCaP cells express AR,
	PAcP, and PSA, and cell growth is stimulated by 5alpha-dihydrotestosterone
	(DHT). Stimulation of cell growth correlates with decreased cellular
	PAcP activity. (ii) In clone 81 LNCaP cells, the expression of PAcP
	decreases with a concurrent decrease in the degree of androgen stimulation
	of cell growth, whereas the expression of PSA mRNA level is up-regulated
	by DHT, as in clone 33 cells. Conversely, in PAcP cDNA-transfected
	clone 81 cells, an additional expression of cellular PAcP correlates
	with an increased stimulation by androgen, higher than the corresponding
	control cells. (iii) PC-3 cells express a low level of functional
	AR with no detectable PAcP or PSA, and the growth of PC-3 cells is
	not affected by DHT treatment. Nevertheless, in two PAcP cDNA-transfected
	PC-3 sublines, the expression of exogenous cellular PAcP correlates
	with androgen stimulation. This androgen stimulation of cell growth
	concurs with an increased tyrosine phosphorylation of a phosphoprotein
	of 185 kDa. In summary, the data indicate that the expression of
	AR alone is not sufficient for androgen stimulation of cell growth.
	Furthermore, in AR-expressing prostate cancer cells, the expression
	of cellular PAcP correlates with androgen stimulation of cell proliferation.},

	Abstract = {The commitment of mammalian cells in late G1 to replicate the genome
	and divide in response to mitogenic growth factors operating via
	tyrosine kinase receptors depends on phosphorylation of the retinoblastoma
	protein (pRb), a process controlled by cyclin D-associated cyclin-dependent
	kinases (cdks) and their inhibitors. This study addressed the issue
	of whether also other mitogenic signalling cascades require activation
	of cyclin D-associated kinases or whether any mitogenic pathway can
	bypass the cyclin D-pRb checkpoint. We show that mitogenic signal
	transduction pathways from three classes of receptors, the membrane
	tyrosine kinase receptors activated by serum mitogens or epidermal
	growth factor, estrogen receptors triggered by estradiol, and the
	cyclic AMP-dependent signalling from G-protein-coupled thyrotropin
	receptors, all converge and strictly require the cyclin D-cdk activity
	to induce S phase in human MCF-7 cells and/or primary dog thyrocytes.
	Combined microinjection and biochemical approaches showed that whereas
	these three mitogenic cascades are sensitive to the p16 inhibitor
	of cdk4/6 and/or cyclin D1-neutralizing antibody and able to induce
	pRb kinase activity, their upstream biochemical routes are distinct
	as demonstrated by their differential sensitivity to lovastatin and
	requirements for mitogen-activated protein kinases whose sustained

	Abstract = {Directing stem cell fate requires knowledge of how signaling networks
	integrate temporally and spatially segregated stimuli. We developed
	and validated a computational model of signal transducer and activator
	of transcription-3 (Stat3) pathway kinetics, a signaling network
	involved in embryonic stem cell (ESC) self-renewal. Our analysis
	identified novel pathway responses; for example, overexpression of
	the receptor glycoprotein-130 results in reduced pathway activation
	and increased ESC differentiation. We used a systematic in silico
	screen to identify novel targets and protein interactions involved
	in Stat3 activation. Our analysis demonstrates that signaling activation
	and desensitization (the inability to respond to ligand restimulation)
	is regulated by balancing the activation state of a distributed set
	of parameters including nuclear export of Stat3, nuclear phosphatase
	activity, inhibition by suppressor of cytokine signaling, and receptor
	trafficking. This knowledge was used to devise a temporally modulated
	ligand delivery strategy that maximizes signaling activation and

	Abstract = {An understanding of the differences and similarities of the retinoid
	X receptor (RXR) and retinoic acid receptor (RAR) systems requires
	knowledge of the diversity of their family members, their patterns
	of expression, and their pharmacological response to ligands. In
	this paper we report the isolation of a family of mouse RXR genes
	encoding three distinct receptors (RXR alpha, beta, and gamma). They
	are closely related to each other in their DNA- and ligand-binding
	domains but are quite divergent from the RAR subfamily in both structure
	and ligand specificity. Recently, we demonstrated that all-trans
	retinoic acid (RA) serves as a "pro-hormone" to the isomer 9-cis
	RA, which is a high-affinity ligand for the human RXR alpha. We extend
	those findings to show that 9-cis RA is also "retinoid X" for mouse
	RXR alpha, beta, and gamma. Trans-activation analyses show that although
	all three RXRs respond to a variety of endogenous retinoids, 9-cis
	RA is their most potent ligand and is up to 40-fold more active than
	all-trans RA. Northern blot and in situ hybridization analyses define
	a broad spectrum of expression for the RXRs, which display unique
	patterns and only partially overlap themselves and the RARs. This
	study suggests that the RXR family plays critical roles in diverse
	aspects of development, from embryo implantation to organogenesis
	and central nervous system differentiation, as well as in adult physiology.},

	Abstract = {Steroid hormones play key roles in regulating cell proliferation and
	differentiation in targeting tissues. However, in advanced cancers,
	the steroid hormone regulation is frequently attenuated through a
	yet unknown mechanism even in the presence of functional steroid
	hormone receptors. We investigate the functional role of tyrosine
	phosphorylation signaling in the hormone-refractory growth of human
	prostate tumors. Initial studies demonstrate that the androgen-responsive
	phenotype of human prostate cancer cells associates with a low phosphotyrosine
	(p-Tyr) level of ErbB-2, which is regulated by cellular prostatic
	acid phosphatase (PAcP), a protein tyrosine phosphatase. In prostate
	cancer cells, the p-Tyr level, but not the protein level, of ErbB-2
	inversely correlates with the androgen-responsiveness of cell proliferation.
	Androgen-stimulated cell growth concurs with a down-regulation of
	cellular PAcP, an elevated p-Tyr level of ErbB-2, and the activation
	of mitogen-activated protein kinases. Furthermore, only the ErbB-2
	inhibitor AG 879, but not the EGFR inhibitor AG 1478, abolishes androgen-induced
	cell proliferation. Forced expression of ErbB-2 can also attenuate
	androgen promotion of cell growth. Data taken collectively conclude

	Abstract = {Human prostatic acid phosphatase (PAcP) is a prostate epithelium-specific
	differentiation antigen. In prostate carcinomas, the cellular PAcP
	is decreased. We investigated its functional role in these cells.
	Several lines of evidence support the hypothesis that cellular PAcP
	functions as a neutral protein-tyrosine phosphatase and is involved
	in regulating prostate cell growth. In this study, we identify its
	in vivo substrate. Our results demonstrated that, in different human
	prostate cancer cell lines, the phosphotyrosine (Tyr(P)) level of
	a 185-kDa phosphoprotein (pp185) inversely correlates with the cellular
	activity of PAcP. On SDS-PAGE, this pp185 co-migrates with the c-ErbB-2
	oncoprotein. Immunodepletion experiments revealed that c-ErbB-2 protein
	is the major pp185 in cells. Results from subclones of LNCaP cells
	indicated the lower the cellular PAcP activity, the higher the Tyr(P)
	levels of c-ErbB-2. This inverse correlation was further observed
	in PAcP cDNA-transfected cells. In clone 33 LNCaP cells, L-(+)-tartrate
	suppresses the cellular PAcP activity and causes an elevated Tyr(P)
	level of c-ErbB-2 protein. Epidermal growth factor stimulates the
	proliferation of LNCaP cells, which concurs with a decreased cellular
	PAcP activity as well as an increased Tyr(P) level of c-ErbB-2. Biochemically,
	PAcP dephosphorylates c-ErbB-2 at pH 7.0. The results thus suggest
	that cellular PAcP down-regulates prostate cell growth by dephosphorylating
	Tyr(P) on c-ErbB-2 oncoprotein in those cells.},

	Abstract = {The production of mature, differentiated myeloid cells is regulated
	by the action of hematopoietic cytokines on progenitor cells in the
	bone marrow. Cytokines drive the process of myeloid differentiation
	by binding to specific cell-surface receptors in a stage- and lineage-specific
	manner. Following the binding of a cytokine to its cognate receptor,
	intracellular signal-transduction pathways become activated that
	facilitate the myeloid differentiation process. These intracellular
	signaling pathways may promote myelopoiesis by stimulating expansion
	of a progenitor pool, supporting cellular survival during the differentiation
	process, or by directly driving the phenotypic changes associated
	with differentiation. Ultimately, pathways that drive the differentiation
	process converge on myeloid transcription factors, including PU.1
	and the C/EBP family, that are critical for differentiation to proceed.
	While much is known about the cytokines, cytokine receptors and transcription
	factors that regulate myeloid differentiation, less is known about
	the precise roles that specific signaling mediators play in promoting
	myeloid differentiation. Recently, however, the application of novel
	pharmacologic inhibitors, siRNA strategies, and transgenic and knockout
	models has begun to shed light on the involvement and function of
	signaling pathways in normal myeloid differentiation. This review
	will discuss the roles that key signaling pathways and mediators

	Abstract = {The elevation of cyclic AMP (cAMP) levels in the cell downregulates
	the activity of the Raf-1 kinase. It has been suggested that this
	effect is due to the activation of cAMP-dependent protein kinase
	(PKA), which can directly phosphorylate Raf-1 in vitro. In this study,
	we confirmed this hypothesis by coexpressing Raf-1 with the constitutively
	active catalytic subunit of PKA, which could fully reproduce the
	inhibition previously achieved by cAMP. PKA-phosphorylated Raf-1
	exhibits a reduced affinity for GTP-loaded Ras as well as impaired
	catalytic activity. As the binding to GTP-loaded Ras induces Raf-1
	activation in the cell, we examined which mechanism is required for
	PKA-mediated Raf-1 inhibition in vivo. A Raf-1 point mutant (RafR89L),
	which is unable to bind Ras, as well as the isolated Raf-1 kinase
	domain were still fully susceptible to inhibition by PKA, demonstrating
	that the phosphorylation of the Raf-1 kinase suffices for inhibition.
	By the use of mass spectroscopy and point mutants, PKA phosphorylation
	site was mapped to a single site in the Raf-1 kinase domain, serine
	621. Replacement of serine 621 by alanine or cysteine or destruction
	of the PKA consensus motif by changing arginine 618 resulted in the
	loss of catalytic activity. Notably, a mutation of serine 619 to
	alanine did not significantly affect kinase activity or regulation
	by activators or PKA. Changing serine 621 to aspartic acid yielded
	a Raf-1 protein which, when expressed to high levels in Sf-9 insect
	cells, retained a very low inducible kinase activity that was resistant
	to PKA downregulation. The purified Raf-1 kinase domain displayed
	slow autophosphorylation of serine 621, which correlated with a decrease
	in catalytic function. The Raf-1 kinase domain activated by tyrosine
	phosphorylation could be downregulated by PKA. Specific removal of
	the phosphate residue at serine 621 reactivated the catalytic activity.
	These results are most consistent with a dual role of serine 621.
	On the one hand, serine 621 appears essential for catalytic activity;
	on the other hand, it serves as a phosphorylation site which confers
	negative regulation.},

	Abstract = {The duration of intracellular signalling is associated with distinct
	biological responses, but how cells interpret differences in signal
	duration are unknown. We show that the immediate early gene product
	c-Fos functions as a sensor for ERK1 (extracellular-signal-regulated
	kinase 1) and ERK2 signal duration. When ERK activation is transient,
	its activity declines before the c-Fos protein accumulates, and under
	these conditions c-Fos is unstable. However, when ERK signalling
	is sustained, c-Fos is phosphorylated by still-active ERK and RSK
	(90K-ribosomal S6 kinase). Carboxy-terminal phosphorylation stabilizes
	c-Fos and primes additional phosphorylation by exposing a docking
	site for ERK, termed the FXFP (DEF) domain. Mutating the DEF domain
	disrupts the c-Fos sensor and c-Fos-mediated signalling. Other immediate
	early gene products that control cell cycle progression, neuronal
	differentiation and circadium rhythms also contain putative DEF domains,
	indicating that multiple sensors exist for sustained ERK signalling.
	Together, our data identify a general mechanism by which cells can

	agents at higher doses. In this study, we determined the combined
	effect of celecoxib, a COX-2 inhibitor, along with exisulind (sulindac
	sulfone/Aptosyn) at low doses in prostate cancer. EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN:
	We used a sequential regimen of N-methyl-N-nitrosourea + testosterone
	to induce prostate cancer in Wistar-Unilever rats. Following carcinogen
	treatment, celecoxib and exisulind individually and their combination
	at low doses were given in NIH-07 diet for 52 weeks. We determined
	the incidence of prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia, adenocarcinomas,
	rate of tumor cell proliferation, and apoptosis. Immunohistochemical
	and Western blot analysis were done to determine COX-2, epidermal
	growth factor receptor (EGFR), Akt, androgen receptor, and cyclin
	D1 expression. Serum prostaglandin E2 and tumor necrosis factor-alpha
	levels were determined using enzyme immunoassay/ELISA assays. RESULTS:
	The rats that received celecoxib in combination with exisulind at
	low doses showed a significant decrease in prostatic intraepithelial
	neoplasia and adenocarcinomas as well as an enhanced rate of apoptosis.
	An overall decrease in COX-2, EGFR, Akt, androgen receptor, and cyclin
	D1 expression was found associated with tumor growth inhibition.
	Reduced serum levels of COX-2 protein, prostaglandin E2, and tumor
	necrosis factor-alpha indicated anti-inflammatory effects. A strong
	inhibition of total and phosphorylated form of EGFR (Tyr(992) and
	Tyr(845)) and Akt (Ser(473)) was significant in rats given with these

	first time that the combination of celecoxib with exisulind at low

	Abstract = {Aberrant activation of the androgen receptor through signaling pathways
	independent of androgen may be responsible for the progression of
	prostate tumors to the rapidly proliferating androgen-independent
	state. In this study, the effects of protein kinase A modulators
	on human androgen receptor activity were tested. Using an adenoviral
	DNA delivery system, we demonstrate that the androgen receptor can
	be activated by a protein kinase A activator, forskolin, in the absence
	of androgen when androgen receptor is co-transfected into monkey
	kidney CV1 cells or human prostate PC-3 cells with androgen-responsive
	reporters. Immunoblotting reveals that there is no significant change
	in androgen receptor protein level following forskolin treatment,
	suggesting that the enhanced activity is due to activation of the
	receptor. This activation can be blocked by a protein kinase A inhibitor
	peptide. Two potent anti-androgens, casodex and flutamide, can significantly
	reduce this activation, confirming that the ligand-independent pathway
	is an androgen receptor-mediated phenomenon. An intact DNA binding
	domain of the receptor is critical for this alternate signaling pathway
	since mutants with reduced DNA binding ability are inactive. The

	most often by inducing MEK/ERK activation. A well-established model
	of CRAF regulation involves RAS-mediated translocation of CRAF to
	the plasma membrane, where it is activated by a series of events
	including phosphorylation. Here we have discovered a new mode of
	regulation that occurs prior to this step. By creating a kinase-defective
	version of CRAF in mice or by use of the RAF inhibitor sorafenib,
	we show that CRAF must first undergo autophosphorylation of serine
	621 (S621). Autophosphorylation occurs in cis, does not involve MEK/ERK
	activation, and is essential to ensure the correct folding and stability
	of the protein. In the absence of S621 phosphorylation, CRAF is degraded
	by the proteasome by mechanisms that do not uniquely rely on the

	for assessing the reproductive effects of environmental and pharmaceutical

	the dynamics of androgenic synthesis, transport, metabolism, and
	regulation of the adult rodent ventral prostate was developed on
	the basis of a model by Barton and Anderson (1997). The model describes
	the systemic and local kinetics of testosterone (T), 5alpha-dihydrotestosterone
	(DHT), and luteinizing hormone (LH), with metabolism of T to DHT
	by 5alpha-reductase in liver and prostate. Also included are feedback
	loops for the positive regulation of T synthesis by LH and negative
	regulation of LH by T and DHT. The model simulates maintenance of
	the prostate as a function of hormone concentrations and androgen
	receptor (AR)-mediated signal transduction. The regulatory processes
	involved in prostate size and function include cell proliferation,
	apoptosis, fluid production, and 5alpha-reductase activity. Each
	process is controlled through the occupancy of a representative gene
	by androgen-AR dimers. The model simulates prostate dynamics for
	intact, castrated, and intravenous T-injected rats. After calibration,

	regresses to approximately 17 and 5\% of its intact weight at 14

	(DHT). This compound is formed in androgen target cells by the enzyme
	5-alpha-reductase. Two isoforms of the 5-alpha-reductase, with limited
	degree of homology, have been cloned, type 1 and type 2. The low
	affinity-constitutive type 1 isoenzyme is widely distributed in the
	body; the high affinity-androgen regulated 5-alpha-reductase type
	2 is confined to androgen-dependent structures and shows a peculiar
	pH optimum at acidic values. We have previously shown that high levels
	of 5-alpha-reductase activity are detectable in rat spinal cord.
	Here, using reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction, we show
	that both isoforms are expressed in the whole spinal cord of the
	rat. The enzymatic pH optimum measured in immortalized spinal cord
	motoneurones (NSC34) is typical of the type 2 isoenzyme. Using in
	situ hybridization technique, we found that 5-alpha-reductase type
	2 is confined to the motoneuronal cells of the anterior horns of
	the rat spinal cord, the cells that also are known to express high
	levels of androgen receptor. Because of the close association of
	androgen receptor and 5-alpha alpha-reductase type 2, motoneuronal
	cells should be considered as target cells for androgens.},

	Abstract = {Prostate-specific antigen (PSA) mRNA was detected by in situ hybridization
	utilizing a 428 base pair [35S]-labelled cDNA probe from the 3' noncoding
	region of the PSA gene. Thirty six fresh surgical specimens were
	collected from patients undergoing radical retropubic prostatectomy
	for carcinoma of the prostate. Quantitative analysis of the levels
	of PSA mRNA in both the benign and malignant tissues was performed
	using an IBAS 2000 Image Analysis System. The results of this study
	demonstrated that there is a significant decrease in the expression
	of PSA mRNA in the carcinoma tissue when compared to the benign epithelium.
	The average binding (number of silver grains/1 x 10(4) microns. 2)
	for 20 specimens of malignant epithelium was 475 +/- 161 and 586
	+/- 140 for 16 specimens of benign epithelium (p less than 0.05).
	Eleven patients had both benign and malignant tissue from the same
	surgical specimen available for study. From these paired specimens,
	the PSA mRNA expression was also significantly reduced in the malignant
	epithelium when compared to the benign epithelium, 445 +/- 162 and
	588 +/- 135 respectively (p less than 0.005). The PSA protein was
	detected using a monoclonal antibody to PSA with an immunohistochemical
	staining technique. The PSA protein expression paralleled the expression
	of the PSA mRNA in the majority of the tissue sections. Many of the
	tumor specimens showed a heterogeneous expression of PSA, whereas
	all of the benign epithelium had a uniform high level of PSA expression.
	In conclusion, PSA mRNA and protein are located only within the glandular
	epithelial tissue, the expression of PSA protein parallels that of
	the PSA mRNA, and both the PSA protein and PSA mRNA are significantly
	decreased in the malignant epithelium when compared to benign prostatic
	epithelium.},

	is activated. In metaphase, Cdc14 is kept inactive in the nucleolus

	chromatid-separating protease separase, activated at anaphase onset,
	interacts with and downregulates PP2A(Cdc55), thereby facilitating
	Cdk-dependent Net1 phosphorylation. PP2A(Cdc55) downregulation also
	promotes phosphorylation of Bfa1, contributing to activation of the
	"mitotic exit network" that sustains Cdc14 as Cdk activity declines.

	regulates myeloid and monocytic differentiation of HL-60 myeloblastic
	leukemia cells in response to retinoic acid (RA) and vitamin D3 (D3),
	respectively. Both RA and D3 decreased the expression of PDGFR-alpha
	and PDGFR-beta throughout differentiation. When cells were treated
	with the PDGFR inhibitor AG1296 in addition to RA or D3, signs of
	terminal differentiation such as inducible oxidative metabolism and
	cell substrate adhesion were enhanced. These changes were accompanied
	by an increased extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1/2 activation.
	AG1296 also resulted in elevated expression of differentiation markers
	CD11b and CD66c when administered with RA or D3. Interestingly, other
	markers did not follow the same pattern. Cells receiving AG1296 in
	addition to RA or D3 showed decreased G1-G0 arrest and CD14, CD38,
	and CD89 expression. We thus provide evidence that certain sets of
	differentiation markers can be enhanced, whereas others can be inhibited
	by the PDGFR pathway. In addition, we found calcium levels to be
	decreased by RA and D3 but increased when AG1296 was given in addition
	to RA or D3, suggesting that calcium levels decrease during myeloid
	or monocytic differentiation, and elevated calcium levels can disturb
	the expression of certain differentiation markers.},

	Abstract = {Expression of prostate-specific antigen (PA) mRNA was tested at various
	time periods after incubation of the human prostate tumor cell line
	LNCaP with the synthetic androgen R1881. Androgen-stimulated expression
	was observed within 6 h after addition of R1881 to the cells. Run-on
	experiments with nuclei isolated from LNCaP cells showed that expression
	of the PA gene could be regulated by R1881 on the level of transcription.
	DNase I footprints of the promoter region of the PA gene (-320 to
	+12) with nuclear protein extracts from LNCaP cells showed at least
	four protected regions. The protected areas include the TATA-box,
	a GC-box sequence, and a sequence AGAACAgcaAGTGCT at position -170
	to -156, which closely resembles the reverse complement of the consensus
	sequence GGTACAnnnTGTTCT for binding of the glucocorticoid receptor
	and the progesterone receptor. Fragments of the PA promoter region
	were cloned in front of the chloramphenicol acetyltransferase (CAT)
	reporter gene and cotransfected with an androgen receptor expression
	plasmid into COS cells in a transient expression assay. CAT activity
	of COS cells grown in the presence of 1 nM R1881 was compared to
	untreated controls. A 110-fold induction of CAT activity was found
	if a -1600 to +12 PA promoter fragment was used in the construct.
	By further deletion mapping of the PA promoter a minimal region (-320
	to -155) was identified as being essential for androgen-regulated
	gene expression. Mutation of the sequence AGAACAgcaAGTGCT (at -170
	to -156) to AAAAAAgcaAGTGCT almost completely abolished androgen
	inducibility of the reporter gene constructs. One or more copies
	of the sequence AGAACAgcaAGTGCT cloned in front of a thymidine kinase
	promoter-CAT reporter gene confers androgen regulation to the reporter
	gene. These findings provide strong evidence for transcription regulation
	of the PA gene by androgens via the sequence AGAACAgcaAGTGCT. Interestingly,
	in addition to the AGAACAgcaAGTGCT element, an upstream region (-539
	to -320) is needed for optimal androgen inducibility of the PA promoter.},

	Abstract = {Kinase Suppressor of Ras (KSR) is a molecular scaffold that interacts
	with the core kinase components of the ERK cascade, Raf, MEK, and
	ERK and provides spatial and temporal regulation of Ras-dependent
	ERK cascade signaling. In this report, we identify the heterotetrameric
	protein kinase, casein kinase 2 (CK2), as a new KSR1-binding partner.
	Moreover, we find that the KSR1/CK2 interaction is required for KSR1
	to maximally facilitate ERK cascade signaling and contributes to
	the regulation of Raf kinase activity. Binding of the CK2 holoenzyme
	is constitutive and requires the basic surface region of the KSR1
	atypical C1 domain. Loss of CK2 binding does not alter the membrane
	translocation of KSR1 or its interaction with ERK cascade components;
	however, disruption of the KSR1/CK2 interaction or inhibition of
	CK2 activity significantly reduces the growth-factor-induced phosphorylation
	of C-Raf and B-Raf on the activating serine site in the negative-charge
	regulatory region (N-region). This decrease in Raf N-region phosphorylation
	further correlates with impaired Raf, MEK, and ERK activation. These
	findings identify CK2 as a novel component of the KSR1 scaffolding
	complex that facilitates ERK cascade signaling by functioning as
	a Raf family N-Region kinase.},

	Abstract = {The serine/threonine protein kinase c-Raf-1 interacts with a number
	of cellular proteins including 14-3-3 isoforms which may be regulators
	or substrates of c-Raf-1 in signal transduction pathways. In vivo
	and in vitro binding analyses of c-Raf-1 and mutant proteins with
	14-3-3 zeta indicate bivalent binding of 14-3-3 zeta to the amino
	terminus as well as to the carboxy terminus of c-Raf-1. Although
	14-3-3 zeta and Ras use different binding regions on the amino terminal
	regulatory domain of c-Raf-1 (c-Raf-NT), 14-3-3 zeta is displaced
	from the amino terminus upon binding of activated Ras. In contrast,
	if c-Raf-1 full length is analysed instead of the separately expressed
	c-Raf-NT, binding of 14-3-3 zeta is only slightly effected by co-expression
	of activated Ras. This is explained by a second binding site of 14-3-3
	zeta at the carboxy terminus of c-Raf-1. The mutant c-Raf-NT (S259A)
	cannot bind 14-3-3 zeta, suggesting a regulatory role of this in
	vivo phosphorylation site. However, c-Raf-NT phosphorylated or unphosphorylated
	at S259, is able to bind 14-3-3 zeta. Even though 14-3-3 zeta can
	be phosphorylated in vivo, only the unphosphorylated form binds to
	the amino terminus of c-Raf-1. The data presented indicate, that
	14-3-3 zeta binds to c-Raf-1 in a bivalent fashion in unstimulated
	cells. 14-3-3 zeta is displaced from the amino terminus but not from
	the carboxy terminus of c-Raf-1 by binding of activated Ras to c-Raf-1.},

@article{Sadar1999,
	Abstract = {To improve the therapy for prostate cancer, it will be necessary to
	address the problems of progression to androgen independence and
	the process of metastatic spread of tumour. The complexity of the
	latter condition is likely to mitigate against the immediate development
	of relevant therapeutic approaches. However, the basis of androgen
	independence appears to be a problem of simpler dimensions and more
	amenable to treatment with current therapeutic technology. Since
	early tumour progression can be detected by an incomplete prostate-specific
	antigen (PSA) response to androgen withdrawal therapy, a study of
	the molecular biology of PSA gene regulation may well provide insight
	into new methods for preventing or delaying this problem. Mounting
	evidence suggests that ligand-independent activation of the androgen
	receptor may be one underlying mechanism of androgen independence.
	In the absence of androgen, a compensatory increase in the activity
	of cAMP-dependent protein kinase (PKA) enhances the ability of the
	androgen receptor to bind to the response elements regulating PSA
	gene expression. The activation of the androgen receptor through
	up-regulation of the PKA signal transduction pathway involves the
	amino-terminus of the androgen receptor, the function of which may
	be altered either by modifications such as phosphorylation, or through
	interactions with co-regulators or other proteins. Of therapeutic
	interest is the fact that this effect can be counteracted experimentally
	by the anti-androgen, bicalutamide, and clinically by several other
	similar agents. We speculate that the inhibition of PKA-activated
	androgen receptor might also be accomplished by decoy molecules that
	can bind to the relevant activated site on the amino-terminus or
	competitively interact with proteins recruited by the PKA pathway
	that are responsible for activating the receptor in the absence of
	androgen. Such molecules might include small mimetic substances or
	agents that can gain access to the nucleus of the cell.},

	Abstract = {The neu protooncogene (also known as c-erbB2, NGL, and HER2) encodes
	a 185-kDa transmembrane glycoprotein with intrinsic tyrosine kinase

	The p185 gene and protein were originally identified in the brain
	and are thought to play a critical role in neurogenesis. Aberrant
	c-erbB2 protein overexpression also occurs in several human adenocarcinomas.
	A ligand for p185, neu-activating factor (NAF), specifically binds
	to neu receptor and increases the p185c-neu tyrosine phosphorylation
	in vitro and in vivo in a dose-dependent manner. We now show that
	NAF specifically binds to purified p185 expressed in baculovirus.
	Direct binding analysis showed that NAF binds with high affinity
	(Kd = 1.3 nM). We have investigated changes in the structure and
	association state of baculovirus-produced neu holoreceptor that are
	induced by ligand binding. In this study, we used sucrose gradients
	to show that purified p185c-neu exists mainly in the monomeric form
	at low concentrations, whereas at higher concentrations p185c-neu
	exists as dimers or multimers. At low concentrations, but in the
	presence of ligand, p185c-neu sediments as a dimeric or multimeric
	form. Monomer-oligomer interconversion is absolutely ligand dependent
	at low receptor concentrations. The high molecular weight form of
	the receptor is enzymatically more active, as a consequence of ligand-driven
	activation of the receptor kinase. Oncogenic p185neu receptors sediment

	Abstract = {The androgen receptor (AR) is a member of the nuclear receptor (NR)
	superfamily that mediates the effects of androgens on target tissues.
	Over the last decade, it has become apparent that NRs require accessory
	factors for optimal activation of target gene expression. Numerous
	NR coregulators have been identified, with diverse structures and
	potential mechanisms of coregulation, creating an increasingly complicated
	picture of NR action. Due to the expanding complexity of the coregulator
	field, this review will focus on the AR ligand-binding domain (LBD)
	and N-terminal interacting proteins identified by our lab. The LBD-interacting
	proteins ARA70, ARA55 and ARA54 were first characterized and ARA70
	was found to have a relatively higher specificity for the AR in human
	prostate cancer DU145 cells. Characterization of the functional relationship
	between the AR and these coregulators indicated that ARA70 and ARA55
	could enhance the androgenic effects of 17beta-estradiol (E2) and
	hydroxyflutamide (HF), an antiandrogen commonly used in the treatment
	of prostate cancer. ARA160, an AR N-terminal interacting protein
	also known as TATA element modulatory factor (TMF), was subsequently
	shown to cooperate with ARA70 in enhancing AR activity. Another AR
	N-terminal interacting protein, ARA24, interacted with the poly-Q
	tract, a region within the N-terminus of the AR linked to Kennedy's
	disease (X-linked spinal and bulbar muscular atrophy). More recently,
	our lab has identified ARA267, a SET domain containing protein, and
	supervillin, an F-actin binding protein, as AR coregulators. Collectively,
	the data from these studies indicate that these coregulators are
	necessary for optimal AR transactivation. Interruption of the interaction
	between AR and these proteins may serve as a new therapeutic target
	in the treatment of prostate cancer.},

@article{Seger1995,
	Abstract = {The transmission of extracellular signals into their intracellular
	targets is mediated by a network of interacting proteins that regulate
	a large number of cellular processes. Cumulative efforts from many
	laboratories over the past decade have allowed the elucidation of
	one such signaling mechanism, which involves activations of several
	membranal signaling molecules followed by a sequential stimulation
	of several cytoplasmic protein kinases collectively known as mitogen-activated
	protein kinase (MAPK) signaling cascade. Up to six tiers in this
	cascade contribute to the amplification and specificity of the transmitted
	signals that eventually activate several regulatory molecules in
	the cytoplasm and in the nucleus to initiate cellular processes such
	as proliferation, differentiation, and development. Moreover, because
	many oncogenes have been shown to encode proteins that transmit mitogenic
	signals upstream of this cascade, the MAPK pathway provides a simple
	unifying explanation for the mechanism of action of most, if not
	all, nonnuclear oncogenes. The pattern of MAPK cascade is not restricted
	to growth factor signaling and it is now known that signaling pathways
	initiated by phorbol esters, ionophors, heat shock, and ligands for
	seven transmembrane receptors use distinct MAPK cascades with little
	or no cross-reactivity between them. In this review we emphasize
	primarily the first MAPK cascade to be discovered that uses the MEK
	and ERK isoforms and describe their involvement in different cellular
	processes.},

	target of rapamycin (mTOR). In this study, we demonstrate that interleukin-3
	stimulation induces a wortmannin-sensitive increase in mTOR kinase
	activity in a myeloid progenitor cell line. The involvement of phosphoinositide
	3'-kinase (PI3K) in the regulation of mTOR activity was further suggested
	by findings that mTOR was phosphorylated in vitro and in vivo by
	the PI3K-regulated protein kinase, AKT/PKB. Although AKT phosphorylated
	mTOR at two COOH-terminal sites (Thr2446 and Ser2448) in vitro, Ser2448
	was the major phosphorylation site in insulin-stimulated or -activated
	AKT-expressing human embryonic kidney cells. Transient transfection
	assays with mTOR mutants bearing Ala substitutions at Ser2448 and/or
	Thr2446 indicated that AKT-dependent mTOR phosphorylation was not
	essential for either PHAS-I phosphorylation or p70S6K activation
	in HEK cells. However, a deletion of amino acids 2430-2450 in mTOR,
	which includes the potential AKT phosphorylation sites, significantly
	increased both the basal protein kinase activity and in vivo signaling
	functions of mTOR. These results demonstrate that mTOR is a direct
	target of the PI3K-AKT signaling pathway in mitogen-stimulated cells,
	and that the identified AKT phosphorylation sites are nested within
	a "repressor domain" that negatively regulates the catalytic activity
	of mTOR. Furthermore, the activation status of the PI3K-AKT pathway
	in cancer cells may be an important determinant of cellular sensitivity
	to the cytostatic effect of rapamycin.},

	Abstract = {Retinoic acid (RA) causes HL-60 human myeloblastic leukemia cell myeloid
	differentiation that is dependent on MAPK signaling. The process
	is propelled by c-Cbl, which binds the CD38 receptor as part of a
	signaling complex generating MAPK signaling. Here we report that
	the capability of c-Cbl to do this is lost in the G306E tyrosine
	kinase-binding domain mutant. Unlike wild-type (WT) c-Cbl, the G306E
	mutant c-Cbl fails to propel RA-induced differentiation, and disrupts
	the normal association with CD38. The G306E mutant does, like WT
	c-Cbl, co-immunoprecipitate with Vav, Slp-76, and p38. But unlike
	WT c-Cbl, does not cause MAPK signaling. In contrast, the C381A Ring
	finger domain mutant functions like WT c-Cbl. It binds CD38 and is
	part of the same apparent c-Cbl/Slp-76/Vav/p38 signaling complex.
	The C381A mutant causes MAPK signaling and propels RA-induced differentiation.
	In addition to HL-60 cells and their WT or mutant c-Cbl stable transfectants,
	the c-Cbl/Vav/Slp-76 complex is also found in NB4 cells where c-Cbl
	was previously also found to bind CD38. The data are consistent with
	a model in which the G306E mutant c-Cbl forms a signaling complex
	that includes Slp-76, Vav, and p38; but does not drive MAPK signaling
	because it fails to bind the CD38 receptor. Without the G306E mutation
	the c-Cbl unites CD38 with the signaling complex and delivers a MAPK
	signal that drives RA-induced differentiation. The results demonstrate
	the importance of the Gly306 residue in the ability of c-Cbl to propel
	RA-induced differentiation.},

	Abstract = {Kinetic properties of the purified alpha, beta, and gamma subspecies
	of protein kinase C (PKC) to respond to diacylglycerol, phosphatidylserine
	(PtdSer), and Ca2+ were reinvestigated in the presence of several
	fatty acids. Although responses of these enzyme subspecies to the
	lipids slightly differed from one another, the reaction velocity
	of these subspecies was significantly enhanced by synergistic action
	of diacylglycerol and a cis-unsaturated fatty acid. Arachidonic,
	oleic, linoleic, linolenic, and docosahexaenoic acids were active
	in this role, whereas saturated fatty acids such as palmitic and
	stearic acids were inactive. Elaidic acid was also inactive. In the
	presence of both PtdSer and diacylglycerol, the cis-unsaturated fatty
	acids increased further an apparent affinity of PKC to Ca2+ and allowed
	the enzyme to exhibit almost full activation at nearly basal levels
	of Ca2+ concentration. The concentration of fatty acid giving rise
	to the maximum activation of enzyme was approximately 20-50 microM.
	The result presented herein implies that the receptor-mediated release
	of unsaturated fatty acids from phospholipids may take part, in synergy
	with diacylglycerol, in the activation of PKC even when the Ca2+
	concentration is low. A possibility arises, then, that the activation
	of PKC is an integral part of the signal-induced degradation cascade
	of various membrane phospholipids, which is initiated by the actions
	of phospholipase C and phospholipase A2.},

	Abstract = {Aggregation of the high affinity receptor for IgE (FcepsilonRI) on
	the mucosal mast cell line, RBL-2H3, results in the rapid and persistent
	tyrosine phosphorylation of Vav. Immunoprecipitation of Vav from
	activated cells revealed co-immunoprecipitated phosphoproteins of
	molecular weights identical to the FcepsilonRI beta and gamma chains,
	and the former was reactive with antibody to the FcepsilonRI beta
	chain. Conversely, Western blots revealed the presence of p95 Vav
	in FcepsilonRI immunoprecipitates. The association of Vav and of
	Grb2 with the receptor was found to be regulated by aggregation of
	the receptor, and the interaction of Vav with the FcepsilonRI was
	localized to the gamma chain. To gain insight on the signaling pathway
	in which Vav participates, we investigated the in vivo associations
	of Vav with other molecules. A reducible chemical cross-linking agent
	was used to covalently maintain protein interactions under nonreducing
	conditions. A fraction of Vav increased in mass to form a complex
	of >300 kDa in molecular mass. Under reducing conditions the cross-linked
	Vav immunoprecipitates showed the presence of Grb2, Raf-1, and p42(mapk)
	(ERK2). In vitro kinase assays of Raf-1 activity associated with
	Vav revealed that this complex had an activity greater than that
	of Raf-1 derived from nonactivated cells, and aggregation of the
	FcepsilonRI did not modulate this activity. In contrast, aggregation
	of the FcepsilonRI increased the total Raf-1 activity by 2-5-fold.
	These results demonstrate that Vav associates constitutively with
	components of the mitogen-activated protein kinase pathway to form
	an active multimeric signaling complex whose in vivo activity and
	associations may be directed by aggregation of the FcepsilonRI. The
	findings of this study may also be relevant to other members of the

	Abstract = {Activation of translation initiation is essential for the malignant
	phenotype and is emerging as a potential therapeutic target. Translation
	is regulated by the expression of translation initiation factor 4E
	(eIF4E) as well as the interaction of eIF4E with eIF4E-binding proteins
	(e.g., 4E-BP1). Rapamycin inhibits translation initiation by decreasing
	the phosphorylation of 4E-BP1, increasing eIF4E/4E-BP1 interaction.
	However, rapamycin also inhibits S6K phosphorylation, leading to
	feedback loop activation of Akt. We hypothesized that targeting eIF4E
	directly would inhibit breast cancer cell growth without activating
	Akt. We showed that eIF4E is ubiquitously expressed in breast cancer
	cell lines. eIF4E knockdown by small interfering RNA inhibited growth
	in different breast cancer cell subtypes including triple-negative
	(estrogen receptor/progesterone receptor/HER-2-negative) cancer cells.
	eIF4E knockdown inhibited the growth of cells with varying total
	and phosphorylated 4E-BP1 levels and inhibited rapamycin-insensitive
	as well as rapamycin-sensitive cell lines. eIF4E knockdown led to
	a decrease in expression of cyclin D1, Bcl-2, and Bcl-xL. eIF4E knockdown
	did not lead to Akt phosphorylation but did decrease 4E-BP1 expression.
	We conclude that eIF4E is a promising target for breast cancer therapy.
	eIF4E-targeted therapy may be efficacious in a variety of breast
	cancer subtypes including triple-negative tumors for which currently
	there are no targeted therapies. Unlike rapamycin and its analogues,
	eIF4E knockdown is not associated with Akt activation.},

	Abstract = {We apply a mathematical model for receptor-mediated cell uptake and
	processing of epidermal growth factor (EGF) to analyze and predict
	proliferation responses to fibroblastic cells transfected with various
	forms of the EGF receptor (EGFR) to EGF. The underlying conceptual
	hypothesis is that the mitogenic signal generated by EGF/EGFR binding
	on the cell surface, via stimulation of receptor tyrosine kinase
	activity, is attenuated when the receptors are downregulated and
	growth factor is depleted by endocytic internalization and subsequent
	intracellular degradation. Hence, the cell proliferation rate ought
	to depend on receptor/ligand binding and trafficking parameters as
	well as on intrinsic receptor signal transduction properties. The
	goal of our modeling efforts is to formulate this hypothesis in quantitative
	terms. The mathematical model consists of kinetic equations for binding,
	internalization, degradation, and recycling of EGF and EGFR, along
	with an expression relating DNA synthesis rate to EGF/EGFR complex
	levels. Parameter values have been previously determined from independent
	binding and trafficking kinetic experiments on B82 fibroblasts transfected
	with wild-type and mutant EGFR. We show that this model can successfully
	interpret literature data for EGF-dependent growth of NR6 fibroblasts
	transfected with wild-type EGFR. Moreover, it successfully predicts
	the literature observation that NR6 cells transfected with a delta
	973 truncation mutant EGFR, which is kinase-active but internalization-deficient,
	require an order of magnitude lower EGF concentration than cells
	with wild-type EGFR for half-maximal proliferation rate. This result
	demonstrates that it may be feasible to genetically engineer mammalian
	cell lines with reduced growth factor requirements by a rational,
	nonempirical approach. We explore by further model computations the
	possibility of exploiting other varieties of EGFR mutants to alter
	growth properties of fibroblastic cells, based on relationships between
	changes in the primary structure of the EGF receptor and the rates
	of specific receptor/ligand binding and trafficking processes. Our
	studies show that the ability to predict cell proliferation as a
	function of serum growth factors such as EGF could lead to the designed
	development of cells with optimized growth responses. This approach
	may also aid in elucidation of mechanisms underlying loss of normal
	cell proliferation control in malignant transformation, by demonstrating
	that receptor trafficking dynamics may in some cases play as important
	a role as intrinsic signal transduction in determining the overall
	resulting mitogenic response.},

	Abstract = {Robustness, a relative insensitivity to perturbations, is a key characteristic

	that are responsible for robust performance are not clear, even in
	genetic circuits of moderate complexity. Formal sensitivity analysis
	allows the investigation of robustness and fragility properties of
	mathematical models representing regulatory networks, but it yields
	only local properties with respect to a particular choice of parameter
	values. Here, we show that by systematically investigating the parameter
	space, more global properties linked to network structure can be

	for generating circadian rhythms in Drosophila as a prototypic dynamical
	cellular system. Analysis of two mathematical models of moderate
	complexity shows that the tradeoff between robustness and fragility
	is largely determined by the regulatory structure. Rank-ordered sensitivities,

	as an influential process determining the oscillator's period. Furthermore,
	sensitivity analysis confirms the theoretical insight that hierarchical

	the quality of life in men with advanced, hormone-refractory prostate
	cancer, but it does not improve survival. We compared such treatment
	with docetaxel plus prednisone in men with this disease. METHODS:
	From March 2000 through June 2002, 1006 men with metastatic hormone-refractory
	prostate cancer received 5 mg of prednisone twice daily and were
	randomly assigned to receive 12 mg of mitoxantrone per square meter
	of body-surface area every three weeks, 75 mg of docetaxel per square
	meter every three weeks, or 30 mg of docetaxel per square meter weekly
	for five of every six weeks. The primary end point was overall survival.
	Secondary end points were pain, prostate-specific antigen (PSA) levels,
	and the quality of life. All statistical comparisons were against
	mitoxantrone. RESULTS: As compared with the men in the mitoxantrone
	group, men in the group given docetaxel every three weeks had a hazard
	ratio for death of 0.76 (95 percent confidence interval, 0.62 to

	docetaxel had a hazard ratio for death of 0.91 (95 percent confidence
	interval, 0.75 to 1.11; P=0.36). The median survival was 16.5 months
	in the mitoxantrone group, 18.9 months in the group given docetaxel
	every 3 weeks, and 17.4 months in the group given weekly docetaxel.
	Among these three groups, 32 percent, 45 percent, and 48 percent
	of men, respectively, had at least a 50 percent decrease in the serum
	PSA level (P<0.001 for both comparisons with mitoxantrone); 22 percent,
	35 percent (P=0.01), and 31 percent (P=0.08) had predefined reductions
	in pain; and 13 percent, 22 percent (P=0.009), and 23 percent (P=0.005)
	had improvements in the quality of life. Adverse events were also
	more common in the groups that received docetaxel. CONCLUSIONS: When
	given with prednisone, treatment with docetaxel every three weeks
	led to superior survival and improved rates of response in terms
	of pain, serum PSA level, and quality of life, as compared with mitoxantrone
	plus prednisone.},

	as effectors of serine phosphorylation. The exact mechanism of their
	action is, however, still largely unknown. Here we demonstrate a
	requirement for 14-3-3 for Raf-1 kinase activity and phosphorylation.
	Expression of dominant negative forms of 14-3-3 resulted in the loss
	of a critical Raf-1 phosphorylation, while overexpression of 14-3-3
	resulted in enhanced phosphorylation of this site. 14-3-3 levels,
	therefore, regulate the stoichiometry of Raf-1 phosphorylation and
	its potential activity in the cell. Phosphorylation of Raf-1, however,
	was insufficient by itself for kinase activity. Removal of 14-3-3
	from phosphorylated Raf abrogated kinase activity, whereas addition
	of 14-3-3 restored it. This supports a paradigm in which the effects
	of phosphorylation on serine as well as tyrosine residues are mediated
	by inducible protein-protein interactions.},

	Abstract = {The role of guanine nucleotides in ras p21 function was determined
	by using the ability of p21 protein to induce maturation of Xenopus
	oocytes as a quantitative assay for biological activity. Two oncogenic
	mutant human N-ras p21 proteins, Asp12 and Val12, actively induced
	maturation, whereas normal Gly12 p21 was relatively inactive in this
	assay. Both mutant proteins were found to be associated with guanosine
	triphosphate (GTP) in vivo. In contrast, Gly12 p21 was predominantly
	guanosine diphosphate (GDP)-bound because of a dramatic stimulation
	of Gly12 p21-associated guanosine triphosphatase (GTPase) activity.
	A cytoplasmic protein was shown to be responsible for this increase
	in activity. This protein stimulated GTP hydrolysis by purified Gly12
	p21 more than 200-fold in vitro, but had no effect on Asp12 or Val12
	mutants. A similar factor could be detected in extracts from mammalian
	cells. It thus appears that, in Xenopus oocytes, this protein maintains
	normal p21 in a biologically inactive, GDP-bound state through its
	effect on GTPase activity. Furthermore, it appears that the major
	effect of position 12 mutations is to prevent this protein from stimulating
	p21 GTPase activity, thereby allowing these mutants to remain in

	Abstract = {Stimulation of PC12 cells with nerve growth factor (NGF) increased
	mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase (MAPKK) activity > 20-fold
	after 5 min to a level that was largely sustained for at least 90
	min. MAPKK activity was stimulated to a similar level by epidermal
	growth factor (EGF), but peaked at 2 min, declining thereafter and
	returning to basal levels after 60-90 min. Activation of MAPKK by
	either growth factor occurred prior to the activation of MAP kinase,
	consistent with MAPKK being the physiological activator of MAP kinase.
	The results demonstrate that the transient activation of MAPKK by
	EGF and its sustained activation by NGF underlies the transient and
	sustained activation of MAP kinase induced by EGF and NGF respectively.
	NGF or EGF induced the same two forms of MAPKK that were resolved
	on a Mono Q column. The Peak-1 MAPKK was activated initially and
	partially converted into the more acidic peak-2 MAPKK after prolonged
	growth-factor stimulation. The Peak-2 MAPKK was 20-fold more sensitive
	to inactivation by the catalytic subunit of protein phosphatase 2A.
	Stimulation with NGF caused a striking translocation of MAP kinase
	from the cytosol to the nucleus after 30 min, but not nuclear translocation
	of MAP kinase occurred after stimulation with EGF. The results suggest
	that sustained activation of the MAP kinase cascade may be required
	for MAP kinase to enter the nucleus, where it may initiate the gene
	transcription events required for neuronal differentiation of PC12

@article{Tzivion1998,
	Abstract = {cRaf-1 is a mitogen-activated protein kinase that is the main effector
	recruited by GTP-bound Ras in order to activate the MAP kinase pathway.
	Inactive Raf is found in the cytosol in a complex with Hsp90, Hsp50
	(Cdc37) and the 14-3-3 proteins. GTP-bound Ras binds Raf and is necessary
	but not sufficient for the stable activation of Raf that occurs in
	response to serum, epidermal growth factor, platelet-derived growth
	factor or insulin. These agents cause a two- to threefold increase
	in overall phosphorylation of Raf on serine/threonine residues, and
	treatment of cRaf-1 with protein (serine/threonine) phosphatases
	can deactivate it, at least partially. The role of 14-3-3 proteins
	in the regulation of Raf's kinase activity is uncertain and is investigated
	here. Active Raf can be almost completely deactivated in vitro by
	displacement of 14-3-3 using synthetic phosphopeptides. Deactivation
	can be substantially reversed by addition of purified recombinant
	bacterial 14-3-3; however, Raf must have been previously activated
	in vivo to be reactivated by 14-3-3 in vitro. The ability of 14-3-3
	to support Raf activity is dependent on phosphorylation of serine
	residues on Raf and on the integrity of the 14-3-3 dimer; mutant
	monomeric forms of 14-3-3, although able to bind Raf in vivo, do
	not enable Raf to be activated in vivo or restore Raf activity after
	displacement of 14-3-3 in vitro. The 14-3-3 protein is not required
	to induce dimerization of Raf. We propose that dimeric 14-3-3 is
	needed both to maintain Raf in an inactive state in the absence of
	GTP-bound Ras and to stabilize an active conformation of Raf produced
	during activation in vivo.},

@article{Veeramani2005,
	Abstract = {Human prostatic acid phosphatase (PAcP) was used as a valuable surrogate
	marker for monitoring prostate cancer prior to the availability of
	prostate-specific antigen (PSA). Even though the level of PAcP is
	increased in the circulation of prostate cancer patients, its intracellular
	level and activity are greatly diminished in prostate cancer cells.
	Recent advances in understanding the function of the cellular form
	of PAcP (cPAcP) have shed some light on its role in prostate carcinogenesis,
	which may have potential applications for prostate cancer therapy.
	It is now evident that cPAcP functions as a neutral protein tyrosine
	phosphatase (PTP) in prostate cancer cells and dephosphorylates HER-2/ErbB-2/Neu
	(HER-2: human epidermal growth factor receptor-2) at the phosphotyrosine
	(p-Tyr) residues. Dephosphorylation of HER-2 at its p-Tyr residues
	results in the down-regulation of its specific activity, which leads
	to decreases in growth and tumorigenicity of those cancer cells.
	Conversely, decreased cPAcP expression correlates with hyperphosphorylation
	of HER-2 at tyrosine residues and activation of downstream extracellular
	signal-regulated kinase (ERK)/mitogen activated protein kinase (MAPK)
	signaling, which results in prostate cancer progression as well as
	androgen-independent growth of prostate cancer cells. These in vitro
	results on the effect of cPAcP on androgen-independent growth of
	prostate cancer cells corroborate the clinical findings that cPAcP
	level is greatly decreased in advanced prostate cancer and provide
	insights into one of the molecular mechanisms involved in prostate
	cancer progression. Results from experiments using xenograft animal
	models further indicate a novel role of cPAcP as a tumor suppressor.
	Future studies are warranted to clarify the use of cPAcP as a therapeutic
	agent in human prostate cancer patients.},

	Abstract = {MAPK signaling is required for retinoic acid (RA)-triggered G(0) cell
	cycle arrest and cell differentiation, but the mechanism is not well
	defined. In this study, RA is found to cause MAPK activation with
	sustained association of RAF to MEK or ERK, leading to a MAPK-dependent
	accumulation of p21(Waf1/Cip1) and binding to CDK2 blocking G(1)/S
	transition. BLR1, a chemokine receptor, was found to function as
	a critical component of RA-triggered MAPK signaling. Unlike wild-type
	parental cells, RA-treated BLR1 knock-out cells failed to show RAF
	and consequential MEK and ERK phosphorylation, failed to accumulate
	CDK inhibitors that control G(1)/S transition, and failed to differentiate
	and arrest in response to RA, whereas ectopically overexpressing
	BLR1 enhanced MAPK signaling and caused accelerated RA-induced differentiation
	and arrest. Ectopic overexpression of RAF enhanced BLR1 expression
	in response to RA, whereas inhibition of RAF or MEK by inhibitors
	or knockdown of RAF by short interfering RNA diminished RA-induced
	BLR1 expression and attenuated differentiation and growth arrest.
	Ectopic expression of the RAF CR3, the catalytically active domain,
	in the BLR1 knock-out restored RA-induced MAPK activation and the
	ability to differentiate and arrest, indicating that RAF effects
	MAPK signaling by BLR1 to propel differentiation/arrest. Taken together,
	RA induces cell differentiation and growth arrest through activation
	of a novel MAPK pathway with BLR1 as a critical component in a positive
	feedback mechanism that may contribute to the prolonged MAPK signaling
	propelling RA-induced cell cycle arrest and differentiation.},

	substrate of ZAP-70. Phosphorylation of SLP-76 is diminished in T
	cells that express a catalytically inactive ZAP-70. Moreover, SLP-76

	that is unable to be tyrosine-phosphorylated attenuates receptor
	function. In addition, the SH2 domain of SLP-76 is required for T-cell
	receptor function, although its role is independent of the ability
	of SLP-76 to undergo tyrosine phosphorylation. As SLP-76 interacts
	with both Grb2 and phospholipase C-gamma1, these data indicate that

	Abstract = {The serine/threonine-specific protein kinase Raf-1 plays a key role
	in mitogenic signal transduction by coupling Ras to the mitogen-activated
	protein (MAP) kinase cascade. Ras-mediated translocation to the plasma
	membrane represents a crucial step in the process of serum-stimulated
	Raf-1 kinase activation. The exact role of the multisite phosphorylation
	in Raf regulation, however, is not clear. We have previously reported
	that the mobility shift-associated hyperphosphorylation of Raf correlates
	with a reduction of serum-stimulated Raf kinase activity (Wartmann,
	M., and Davis, R. J. (1994) J. Biol. Chem. 269, 6695-6701). Here
	we show that incubation of serum-starved CHO cells with D609, a purported
	inhibitor of phosphatidylcholine-specific phospholipase C, also results
	in a mobility shift of Raf-1 that is due to hyperphosphorylation
	on sites identical to those observed following mitogen stimulation.
	Subcellular fractionation analyses revealed that D609-induced mobility
	shift-associated hyperphosphorylation was paralleled by a decreased
	membrane association of Raf-1. Similar results were obtained in an
	in vitro reconstitution system. Furthermore, PD98059, a specific
	inhibitor of activation of the MAP kinase kinase MEK, prevented D609-induced
	Raf hyperphosphorylation and restored the amount of membrane-bound
	Raf to control levels. Taken together, these data suggest that mobility
	shift-associated hyperphosphorylation of Raf-1, by virtue of reducing
	the amount of plasma membrane-bound Raf-1, represents a negative
	feedback mechanism contributing to the desensitization of the MAP
	kinase signaling cascade.},

	and reacting quickly to extracellular stimuli detected by membrane-bound
	receptors and proteins. Reversible phosphorylation of intracellular

	the transmission and modulation of such signals and is determined

	Recently, genetic and biochemical analyses have identified the universally
	conserved mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinase cascade as one of
	the most ubiquitous signal transduction systems. This pathway is
	activated after a variety of cellular stimuli and regulates numerous
	physiological processes, particularly the cell division cycle. Progression

	most tumors responding to androgen deprivation therapies, but the
	molecular basis for this androgen dependence has not been determined.
	Androgen [5alpha-dihydrotestosterone (DHT)] stimulation of LNCaP
	prostate cancer cells, which have constitutive phosphatidylinositol
	3-kinase (PI3K)/Akt pathway activation due to PTEN loss, caused increased
	expression of cyclin D1, D2, and D3 proteins, retinoblastoma protein
	hyperphosphorylation, and cell cycle progression. However, cyclin
	D1 and D2 message levels were unchanged, indicating that the increases
	in cyclin D proteins were mediated by a post-transcriptional mechanism.
	This mechanism was identified as mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR)
	activation. DHT treatment increased mTOR activity as assessed by
	phosphorylation of the downstream targets p70 S6 kinase and 4E-BP1,
	and mTOR inhibition with rapamycin blocked the DHT-stimulated increase
	in cyclin D proteins. Significantly, DHT stimulation of mTOR was
	not mediated through activation of the PI3K/Akt or mitogen-activated
	protein kinase/p90 ribosomal S6 kinase pathways and subsequent tuberous
	sclerosis complex 2/tuberin inactivation or by suppression of AMP-activated
	protein kinase. In contrast, mTOR activation by DHT was dependent
	on AR-stimulated mRNA synthesis. Oligonucleotide microarrays showed
	that DHT-stimulated rapid increases in multiple genes that regulate
	nutrient availability, including transporters for amino acids and
	other organic ions. These results indicate that a critical function
	of AR in PTEN-deficient prostate cancer cells is to support the pathologic
	activation of mTOR, possibly by increasing the expression of proteins
	that enhance nutrient availability and thereby prevent feedback inhibition

	memory correlated with alterations in nuclear architecture detected
	by narrow angle light scatter using flow cytometry. The altered nuclear
	architecture first occurred before any overt cell differentiation

	pathway--retinoic acid selectively utilizes ERK but not JNK/SAPK
	or p38 when inducing myeloid differentiation of HL-60 human myeloblastic

	JNK/SAPK or p38 are not activated by retinoic acid. Presumably because

	middle T antigen, as well as certain transformation defective mutants
	thereof, is known to promote retinoic acid-induced differentiation,

	ectopic expression of either the polyoma middle T antigen or its
	dl23 mutant, which is defective for PLCgamma and PI-3 kinase activation,
	or the delta205 mutant, which in addition is also weakened for activation

	signaling relevant to retinoic acid-induced differentiation is thus
	restricted to ERK2 and does not involve JNK/SAPK or p38. Taken together,

	Abstract = {Retinoic acid (RA) activated the extracellular signal-regulated kinase
	(ERK) 2 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) of HL-60 human myeloblastic
	leukemia cells before causing myeloid differentiation and cell cycle
	arrest associated with hypophosphorylation of the retinoblastoma
	(RB) tumor suppressor protein. ERK2 activation by mitogen-activated
	protein/ERK kinase (MEK) was necessary for RA-induced differentiation
	in studies using PD98059 to block MEK phosphorylation. G0 growth
	arrest and RB tumor suppressor protein hypophosphorylation (which
	is typically associated with induced differentiation and G0 arrest),
	two putatively RB-regulated processes, also depended on ERK2 activation
	by MEK. Activation of ERK2 by RA occurred within hours and persisted
	until the onset of RB hypophosphorylation, differentiation, and arrest.
	ERK2 activation was probably needed early, because delaying the addition
	of PD98059 relative to that of RA restored most of the RA-induced
	cellular response. In contrast to RA (which activates RA receptors
	(RARs) and retinoid X receptors in HL-60 cells with its metabolite
	retinoids), a retinoid that selectively binds RAR-{gamma}, which
	is not expressed in HL-60 cells, was relatively ineffective in causing
	ERK2 activation. This is consistent with the need for a nuclear retinoid
	receptor function in RA-induced ERK2 activation. RA reduced the amount
	of unphosphorylated RAR-{alpha}, whose activation is necessary for
	RA-induced differentiation and arrest. This shifted the ratio of

	Abstract = {Retinoic acid (RA) activated the extracellular signal-regulated kinase
	(ERK) 2 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) of HL-60 human myeloblastic
	leukemia cells before causing myeloid differentiation and cell cycle
	arrest associated with hypophosphorylation of the retinoblastoma
	(RB) tumor suppressor protein. ERK2 activation by mitogen-activated
	protein/ERK kinase (MEK) was necessary for RA-induced differentiation
	in studies using PD98059 to block MEK phosphorylation. G0 growth
	arrest and RB tumor suppressor protein hypophosphorylation (which
	is typically associated with induced differentiation and G0 arrest),
	two putatively RB-regulated processes, also depended on ERK2 activation
	by MEK. Activation of ERK2 by RA occurred within hours and persisted
	until the onset of RB hypophosphorylation, differentiation, and arrest.
	ERK2 activation was probably needed early, because delaying the addition
	of PD98059 relative to that of RA restored most of the RA-induced
	cellular response. In contrast to RA (which activates RA receptors
	(RARs) and retinoid X receptors in HL-60 cells with its metabolite
	retinoids), a retinoid that selectively binds RAR-gamma, which is
	not expressed in HL-60 cells, was relatively ineffective in causing
	ERK2 activation. This is consistent with the need for a nuclear retinoid
	receptor function in RA-induced ERK2 activation. RA reduced the amount
	of unphosphorylated RAR-alpha, whose activation is necessary for
	RA-induced differentiation and arrest. This shifted the ratio of
	phosphorylated:unphosphorylated RAR-alpha to predominantly the phosphorylated

	Abstract = {Increasing the expression of c-FMS (colony-stimulating factor 1 receptor)
	by introduction of a transgene reduced the concentration of retinoic
	acid or 1,25-dihydroxy vitamin D3 needed to cause myeloid or monocytic
	cell differentiation and hypophosphorylation of the retinoblastoma
	tumor suppressor protein (RB) typically associated with cell cycle
	G0 arrest and differentiation of HL-60 human myelo-monoblastic precursor
	cells. The data are consistent with a model in which signals originating
	with retinoic acid and c-FMS integrate to cause differentiation,
	RB hypophosphorylation, and G0 arrest. Furthermore, these two signals
	can compensate for each other. Three HL-60 sublines described previously
	(A. Yen et al., Exp. Cell Res., 229: 111-125, 1996) expressing low
	(wild-type HL-60), intermediate, and high cell surface c-FMS were
	treated with various concentrations of retinoic acid. The lowest
	concentration tested, 10(-8) M, induced significant differentiation
	of only the high c-FMS-expressing cells, with no accompanying hypophosphorylated
	RB or G0 arrest. The low and intermediate c-FMS expressing cells
	showed no induced differentiation, hypophosphorylation of RB, or
	G0 arrest. A 10-fold higher retinoic acid concentration, 10(-1) M,
	induced significant differentiation of both intermediate and high
	c-FMS-expressing cells. It induced RB hypophosphorylation only in
	high c-FMS-expressing cells but with no accompanying G0 arrest in
	any of the cells. The highest retinoic acid concentration, 10(-6)
	M, elicited differentiation, hypophosphorylation of RB, and G0 arrest
	in low, intermediate, and high c-FMS-expressing cells. As the concentration
	of retinoic acid increased, cell differentiation, hypophosphorylation
	of RB, and G0 arrest were progressively elicited within this ensemble
	of cells with different c-FMS expression levels. Thus, for example,
	at the lowest concentration of retinoic acid, expression of high
	enough c-FMS still allowed differentiation. At higher concentrations,
	progressively less c-FMS was needed for differentiation. The apparent
	threshold for the sum of the retinoic acid plus c-FMS originated
	signals to elicit differentiation, hypophosphorylation of RB, and
	G0 arrest increased, in that order. Thus retinoic acid-induced cell
	differentiation, RB hypophosphorylation, and G0 arrest have different
	signal threshold requirements. 1,25-Dihydroxy vitamin D3, also a
	ligand for a member of the steroid thyroid hormone receptor superfamily,
	caused monocytic differentiation with a similar c-FMS dependency,
	indicating that these effects characterize both myeloid and monocytic

	of SLP-76 (Src-homology 2 domain-containing leukocyte-specific phospho-protein
	of 76 kDa), which became a prominent tyrosine-phosphorylated protein
	in RA-treated cells. SLP-76 is a known adaptor molecule associated
	with T-cell receptor and MAPK signaling. To characterize functional
	effects of SLP-76 expression in RA-induced differentiation and G0
	arrest, HL-60 cells were stably transfected with SLP-76. Expression
	of SLP-76 had no discernable effect on RA-induced ERK activation,

	Abstract = {Expression of an activated raf transgene accelerated the terminal
	myeloid differentiation of HL-60 human promyelocytic leukemia cells
	induced by retinoic acid. A similar result was obtained when 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin
	D3 was used to induce monocytic differentiation. The stable transfectants
	were derived by transfecting HL-60 cells with DNA encoding an N-terminal
	truncated raf-1 protein. In normal HL-60 cells retinoic acid is known
	to induce a colony-stimulating factor-1 (CSF-1)-dependent metabolic
	cascade culminating in G0 arrest and phenotypic conversion. Early
	in this cascade, expression of the RB tumor suppressor gene product
	is down-regulated. A progressive redistribution of the form of the
	protein from largely hyperphosphorylated protein to the hypophosphorylated
	form begins later with G0 arrest and differentiation. In the activated
	raf-transfected cells, RB down regulation occurred more rapidly,
	consistent with accelerated differentiation. But the conversion to
	the hypophosphorylated form was not accelerated and occurred after
	G0 arrest and phenotypic conversion to myeloid differentiated cells.
	Thus raf activation appears to be a component of the induced metabolic
	cascade culminating in terminal differentiation. In this cascade
	raf activation promotes RB down-regulation. The data are consistent
	with a model in which raf is an effector of the CSF-1-dependent metabolic

	downregulation is one of the downstream consequences of RAF action.
	Furthermore, they indicate that RB down-regulation may be an essential

	HER-2 receptor overexpression was evaluated using immunohistochemistry

	upstream activators of Raf-1 are Ras and Src. This study shows that
	MEK1, the direct downstream effector of Raf-1, can also stimulate
	Raf-1 kinase activity by a positive feedback loop. Activated MEK1
	mediates hyperphosphorylation of the amino terminal regulatory as
	well as of the carboxy terminal catalytic domain of Raf-1. The hyperphosphorylation
	of Raf-1 correlates with a change in the tryptic phosphopeptide pattern
	only at the carboxy terminus of Raf-1 and an increase in Raf-1 kinase
	activity. MEK1-mediated Raf-1 activation is inhibited by co-expression
	of the MAPK specific phosphatase MKP-1 indicating that the MEK1 effect
	is exerted through a MAPK dependent pathway. Stimulation of Raf-1
	activity by MEK1 is independent of Ras, Src and tyrosine phosphorylation
	of Raf-1. MEK1 can however synergize with Ras and leads to further
	increase of the Raf-1 kinase activity. Thus, MEK1 can mediate activation

	Abstract = {PURPOSE: The ErbB1 and ErbB2 receptors have been implicated in prostate
	cancer progression, but less is known about the role and biology
	of other ErbB receptor family members in prostate cancer. The aim
	of this study was to analyze the expression and localization of ErbB3
	in prostate tissues and prostate cancer cell lines. EXPERIMENTAL
	DESIGN: Immunohistochemistry of ErbB3 was done on prostate cancer
	tissue sections from 143 patients and on a tissue microarray containing
	390 cores of radical prostatectomy-derived specimens representing
	normal, prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia, and malignant tissues
	from 81 patients. ErbB3 subcellular localization was studied by Western
	blot analysis in LNCaP, 22Rv1, PC-3, and DU145 prostate cancer cell
	lines. RESULTS: Immunohistochemistry analysis of prostate cancer
	tissues revealed that >90\% of prostate cancer tissues displayed
	cytoplasmic ErbB3 staining. Minimal ErbB3 nuclear staining was observed
	in normal prostate tissues and benign prostatic hyperplasia tissues;
	in contrast, ErbB3 was frequently localized in the nucleus of cancerous
	tissues. This nuclear localization was more frequent (P < 0.001)
	in hormone-refractory tissues (17 of 17, 100\%) compared with hormone-sensitive
	samples (37 of 92, 40.2\%). Additionally, in the tissue microarray,
	increased nuclear ErbB3 was associated with increasing Gleason grade.
	Interestingly, Western blot analysis of cytoplasmic and nuclear subcellular
	fractions showed that ErbB3 nuclear localization was more prevalent
	in hormone-sensitive prostate cancer cell lines (LNCaP and 22Rv1)
	compared with hormone-insensitive cell lines (PC-3 and DU145). CONCLUSIONS:
	ErbB3 nuclear localization discriminates normal from malignant prostate
	tissues and between tumors from hormone-sensitive versus hormone-refractory
	prostate cancer. ErbB3 nuclear staining seems to be associated with
	risk of disease progression. The high frequency of ErbB3 nuclear
	localization in hormone-refractory tissues indicates that ErbB3 warrants
	further study to understand its association with prostate cancer
	disease progression.},

	kinase inhibitors in patients with advanced non-small cell lung cancer

	a single base pair change leading to a threonine to methionine (T790M)
	amino acid alteration in the ATP-binding pocket of the EGFR as a

	CL-387,785. We did a transcriptional profiling study of mutant EGFR
	target genes that are differentially expressed in the "resistant"
	gefitinib-treated and the "sensitive" CL387,785-treated H1975 cells
	to identify the pivotal transcriptional changes in NSCLC with EGFR-activating
	mutations. We identified a small subset of early gene changes, including
	significant reduction of cyclin D1 as a result of EGFR inhibition
	by CL-387,785 but not by gefitinib. The reduction in cyclin D1 transcription
	was associated with subsequent suppression of E2F-responsive genes,
	consistent with proliferation arrest. Furthermore, cyclin D1 expression
	was higher in EGFR-mutant lung cancer cells compared with cells with
	wild-type EGFR. EGFR-mutant cells were routinely sensitive to the
	cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor flavopiridol, confirming the functional
	relevance of the cyclin D axis. These studies suggest that cyclin

	All these data indicate that ERBB2 is a marker of aggressiveness

	significance in multivariate analyses, since it is associated with
	several strong prognostic parameters. When considering the prognostic

	Abstract = {Computational models are increasingly used to understand and predict complex biological phenomena. These models contain many unknown parameters, at least some of which are difficult to measure directly, and instead are estimated by fitting to time-course data. Previous work has suggested that even with precise data sets, many parameters are unknowable by trajectory measurements. We examined this question in the context of a pathway model of epidermal growth factor (EGF) and neuronal growth factor (NGF) signaling. Computationally, we examined a palette of experimental perturbations that included different doses of EGF and NGF as well as single and multiple gene knockdowns and overexpressions. While no single experiment could accurately estimate all of the parameters, experimental design methodology identified a set of five complementary experiments that could. These results suggest optimism for the prospects for calibrating even large models, that the success of parameter estimation is intimately linked to the experimental perturbations used, and that experimental design methodology is important for parameter fitting of biological models and likely for the accuracy that can be expected from them.},

The integration of metabolic and signalling cues allows cells to modulate activities such as metabolism, cell survival and proliferation according to their intracellular metabolic resources.},

@article{2012_miller_lauffenburger_weiss_PLoSCompBio,
	Abstract = {Synthetic biology efforts have largely focused on small engineered gene networks, yet understanding how to integrate multiple synthetic modules and interface them with endogenous pathways remains a challenge. Here we present the design, system integration, and analysis of several large scale synthetic gene circuits for artificial tissue homeostasis. Diabetes therapy represents a possible application for engineered homeostasis, where genetically programmed stem cells maintain a steady population of β-cells despite continuous turnover. We develop a new iterative process that incorporates modular design principles with hierarchical performance optimization targeted for environments with uncertainty and incomplete information. We employ theoretical analysis and computational simulations of multicellular reaction/diffusion models to design and understand system behavior, and find that certain features often associated with robustness (e.g., multicellular synchronization and noise attenuation) are actually detrimental for tissue homeostasis. We overcome these problems by engineering a new class of genetic modules for 'synthetic cellular heterogeneity' that function to generate beneficial population diversity. We design two such modules (an asynchronous genetic oscillator and a signaling throttle mechanism), demonstrate their capacity for enhancing robust control, and provide guidance for experimental implementation with various computational techniques. We found that designing modules for synthetic heterogeneity can be complex, and in general requires a framework for non-linear and multifactorial analysis. Consequently, we adapt a 'phenotypic sensitivity analysis' method to determine how functional module behaviors combine to achieve optimal system performance. We ultimately combine this analysis with Bayesian network inference to extract critical, causal relationships between a module's biochemical rate-constants, its high level functional behavior in isolation, and its impact on overall system performance once integrated.},

	Abstract = {Natural and synthetic biological networks must function reliably in the face of fluctuating stoichiometry of their molecular components. These fluctuations are caused in part by changes in relative expression efficiency and the DNA template amount of the network-coding genes. Gene product levels could potentially be decoupled from these changes via built-in adaptation mechanisms, thereby boosting network reliability. Here, we show that a mechanism based on an incoherent feedforward motif enables adaptive gene expression in mammalian cells. We modeled, synthesized, and tested transcriptional and post-transcriptional incoherent loops and found that in all cases the gene product adapts to changes in DNA template abundance. We also observed that the post-transcriptional form results in superior adaptation behavior, higher absolute expression levels, and lower intrinsic fluctuations. Our results support a previously hypothesized endogenous role in gene dosage compensation for such motifs and suggest that their incorporation in synthetic networks will improve their robustness and reliability.},

	Abstract = {Modeling of signal transduction pathways plays a major role in understanding cells' function and predicting cellular response. Mathematical formalisms based on a logic formalism are relatively simple but can describe how signals propagate from one protein to the next and have led to the construction of models that simulate the cells response to environmental or other perturbations. Constrained fuzzy logic was recently introduced to train models to cell specific data to result in quantitative pathway models of the specific cellular behavior. There are two major issues in this pathway optimization: i) excessive CPU time requirements and ii) loosely constrained optimization problem due to lack of data with respect to large signaling pathways. Herein, we address both issues: the former by reformulating the pathway optimization as a regular nonlinear optimization problem; and the latter by enhanced algorithms to pre/post-process the signaling network to remove parts that cannot be identified given the experimental conditions. As a case study, we tackle the construction of cell type specific pathways in normal and transformed hepatocytes using medium and large-scale functional phosphoproteomic datasets. The proposed Non Linear Programming (NLP) formulation allows for fast optimization of signaling topologies by combining the versatile nature of logic modeling with state of the art optimization algorithms.},

	Abstract = {Predictive understanding of cell signaling network operation based on general prior knowledge but consistent with empirical data in a specific environmental context is a current challenge in computational biology. Recent work has demonstrated that Boolean logic can be used to create context-specific network models by training proteomic pathway maps to dedicated biochemical data; however, the Boolean formalism is restricted to characterizing protein species as either fully active or inactive. To advance beyond this limitation, we propose a novel form of fuzzy logic sufficiently flexible to model quantitative data but also sufficiently simple to efficiently construct models by training pathway maps on dedicated experimental measurements. Our new approach, termed constrained fuzzy logic (cFL), converts a prior knowledge network (obtained from literature or interactome databases) into a computable model that describes graded values of protein activation across multiple pathways. We train a cFL-converted network to experimental data describing hepatocytic protein activation by inflammatory cytokines and demonstrate the application of the resultant trained models for three important purposes: (a) generating experimentally testable biological hypotheses concerning pathway crosstalk, (b) establishing capability for quantitative prediction of protein activity, and (c) prediction and understanding of the cytokine release phenotypic response. Our methodology systematically and quantitatively trains a protein pathway map summarizing curated literature to context-specific biochemical data. This process generates a computable model yielding successful prediction of new test data and offering biological insight into complex datasets that are difficult to fully analyze by intuition alone.},

In this paper we apply a fuzzy logic framework to the analysis of a large, systematic dataset describing the dynamics of cell signaling downstream of TNF, EGF, and insulin receptors in human colon carcinoma cells. Simulations based on fuzzy logic recapitulate most features of the data and generate several predictions involving pathway crosstalk and regulation. We uncover a relationship between MK2 and ERK pathways that might account for the previously identified pro-survival influence of MK2. We also find unexpected inhibition of IKK following EGF treatment, possibly due to down-regulation of autocrine signaling.

	Abstract = {The protein p53 functions as a tumor suppressor and can trigger either cell cycle arrest or apoptosis in response to DNA damage. We used Boolean network modeling and attractor landscape analysis to analyze the state transition dynamics of a simplified p53 network for which particular combinations of activation states of the molecules corresponded to specific cellular outcomes. Our results identified five critical interactions in the network that determined the cellular response to DNA damage, and simulations lacking any of these interactions produced states associated with sustained p53 activity, which corresponded to a cell death response. Attractor landscape analysis of the cellular response to DNA damage of the breast cancer cell line MCF7 and the effect of the Mdm2 (murine double minute 2) inhibitor nutlin-3 indicated that nutlin-3 would exhibit limited efficacy in triggering cell death, because the cell death state was not induced to a large extent by simulations with nutlin-3 and instead produced a state consistent with oscillatory p53 dynamics and cell cycle arrest. Attractor landscape analysis also suggested that combining nutlin-3 with inhibition of Wip1 would synergize to stimulate a sustained increase in p53 activity and promote p53-mediated cell death. We validated this synergistic effect in stimulating p53 activity and triggering cell death with single-cell imaging of a fluorescent p53 reporter in MCF7 cells. Thus, attractor landscape analysis of p53 network dynamics and its regulation can identify potential therapeutic strategies for treating cancer.},

	Abstract = {BACKGROUND: Most of the modeling performed in the area of systems biology aims at achieving a quantitative description of the intracellular pathways within a "typical cell". However, in many biologically important situations even clonal cell populations can show a heterogeneous response. These situations require study of cell-to-cell variability and the development of models for heterogeneous cell populations.
RESULTS: In this paper we consider cell populations in which the dynamics of every single cell is captured by a parameter dependent differential equation. Differences among cells are modeled by differences in parameters which are subject to a probability density. A novel Bayesian approach is presented to infer this probability density from population snapshot data, such as flow cytometric analysis, which do not provide single cell time series data. The presented approach can deal with sparse and noisy measurement data. Furthermore, it is appealing from an application point of view as in contrast to other methods the uncertainty of the resulting parameter distribution can directly be assessed.
CONCLUSIONS: The proposed method is evaluated using artificial experimental data from a model of the tumor necrosis factor signaling network. We demonstrate that the methods are computationally efficient and yield good estimation result even for sparse data sets.},

Much recent work on robustness and evolvability has focused on the structure of neutral spaces, in which system behavior remains invariant to mutations. Recently we have shown that the collective behavior of multiparameter models is most often sloppy: insensitive to changes except along a few 'stiff' combinations of parameters, with an enormous sloppy neutral subspace. Robustness is often assumed to be an emergent evolved property, but the sloppiness natural to biochemical networks offers an alternative nonadaptive explanation. Conversely, ideas developed to study evolvability in robust systems can be usefully extended to characterize sloppy systems.},

	Abstract = {Physiological and psychological stresses cause anxiety disorders such as depression and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and induce drastic changes at a molecular level in the brain. To counteract this stress, the heat-shock protein (HSP) network plays a vital role in restoring the homeostasis of the system. To study the stress-induced dynamics of heat-shock network, we analyzed three modules of the HSP90 network--namely trimerization reactions, phosphorylation-dephosphorylation reactions, and the conversion of HSP90 from an open to a closed conformation--and constructed a corresponding nonlinear differential equation model based on mass action kinetics laws. The kinetic parameters of the model were obtained through global optimization, and sensitivity analyses revealed that the most sensitive parameters are the kinase and phosphatase that drive the phosphorylation-dephosphorylation reactions. Bifurcation analysis carried out with the estimated kinetic parameters of the model with stress as bifurcation parameter revealed the occurrence of "mushroom", a type of complex dynamics in which S-shaped and Z-shaped hysteretic bistable forms are present together. We mapped the molecular events responsible for generating the mushroom dynamics under stress and interpreted the occurrence of the S-shaped hysteresis to a normal level of stress, and the Z-shaped hysteresis to the HSP90 variations under acute and chronic stress in the fear conditioned system, and further, we hypothesized that this can be extended to stress-related disorders such as depression and PTSD in humans. Finally, we studied the effect of parameter variations on the mushroom dynamics to get insight about the role of phosphorylation-dephosphorylation parameters in HSP90 network in bringing about complex dynamics such as isolas, where the stable steady states in a bistable system are isolated and separated from each other and not connected by an unstable steady state.},

	Abstract = {Cortisol, secreted in the adrenal cortex in response to stress, is an informative biomarker that distinguishes anxiety disorders such as major depression and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) from normal subjects. Yehuda et al. proposed a hypothesis that, in humans, the hypersensitive hypothalamus-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis is responsible for the occurrence of differing levels of cortisol in anxiety disorders. Specifically, PTSD subjects have lower cortisol levels during the late subjective night in comparison to normal subjects, and this was assumed to occur due to strong negative feedback loops in the HPA axis. In the present work, to address this hypothesis, we modeled the cortisol dynamics using nonlinear ordinary differential equations and estimated the kinetic parameters of the model to fit the experimental data of three categories, namely, normal, depressed, and PTSD human subjects. We concatenated the subjects (n = 3) in each category and created a model subject (n = 1) without considering the patient-to-patient variability in each case. The parameters of the model for the three categories were simultaneously obtained through global optimization. Bifurcation analysis carried out with the optimized parameters exhibited two supercritical Hopf points and, for the choice of parameters, the oscillations were found to be circadian in nature. The fitted kinetic parameters indicate that PTSD subjects have a strong negative feedback loop and, as a result, the predicted oscillating cortisol levels are extremely low at the nadir in contrast to normal subjects, albeit within the endocrinologic range. We also simulated the phenotypes for each of the categories and, as observed in the clinical data of PTSD patients, the simulated cortisol levels are consistently low at the nadir, and correspondingly the negative feedback was found to be extremely strong. These results from the model support the hypothesis that high stress intensity and strong negative feedback loop may cause hypersensitive neuro-endocrine axis that results in hypocortisolemia in PTSD.},

	Abstract = {Classical sensitivity analysis is routinely used to identify points of fragility or robustness in biochemical networks. However, intracellular systems often contain components that number in the thousands to tens or less and consequently motivate a stochastic treatment. Although methodologies exist to quantify sensitivities in stochastic models, they differ substantially from those used in deterministic regimes. Therefore it is not possible to tell whether observed differences in sensitivity measured in deterministic and stochastic elaborations of the same network are the result of methodology or model form. The authors introduce here a distribution-based methodology to measure sensitivity that is equally applicable in both regimes, and demonstrate its use and applicability on a sophisticated mathematical model of the mouse circadian clock that is available in both deterministic and stochastic variants. The authors use the method to produce sensitivity measurements on both variants. They note that the rank-order sensitivity of the clock to parametric perturbations is extremely well conserved across several orders of magnitude. The data show that the clock is fragile to perturbations in parameters common to the cellular machinery ('global' parameters) and robust to perturbations in parameters that are clock-specific ('local' parameters). The sensitivity measure can be used to reduce the model from its original 73 ordinary differential equations (ODEs) to 18 ODEs and to predict the degree to which parametric perturbation can distort the phase response curve of the clock. Finally, the method is employed to evaluate the effect of transcriptional and translational noise on clock function. [Includes supplementary material].},

	Abstract = {Sensitivity analysis quantifies the dependence of system behavior on the parameters that affect the process dynamics. Classical sensitivity analysis, however, does not directly apply to discrete stochastic dynamical systems, which have recently gained popularity because of its relevance in the simulation of biological processes. In this work, sensitivity analysis for discrete stochastic processes is developed based on density function (distribution) sensitivity, using an analog of the classical sensitivity and the Fisher Information Matrix. There exist many circumstances, such as in systems with multistability, in which the stochastic effects become nontrivial and classical sensitivity analysis on the deterministic representation of a system cannot adequately capture the true system behavior. The proposed analysis is applied to a bistable chemical system--the Schl{\"o}gl model, and to a synthetic genetic toggle-switch model. Comparisons between the stochastic and deterministic analyses show the significance of explicit consideration of the probabilistic nature in the sensitivity analysis for this class of processes.},

	Abstract = {Robustness, a relative insensitivity to perturbations, is a key characteristic of living cells. However, the specific structural characteristics that are responsible for robust performance are not clear, even in genetic circuits of moderate complexity. Formal sensitivity analysis allows the investigation of robustness and fragility properties of mathematical models representing regulatory networks, but it yields only local properties with respect to a particular choice of parameter values. Here, we show that by systematically investigating the parameter space, more global properties linked to network structure can be derived. Our analysis focuses on the genetic oscillator responsible for generating circadian rhythms in Drosophila as a prototypic dynamical cellular system. Analysis of two mathematical models of moderate complexity shows that the tradeoff between robustness and fragility is largely determined by the regulatory structure. Rank-ordered sensitivities, for instance, allow the correct identification of protein phosphorylation as an influential process determining the oscillator's period. Furthermore, sensitivity analysis confirms the theoretical insight that hierarchical control might be important for achieving robustness. The complex feedback structures encountered in vivo, however, do not seem to enhance robustness per se but confer robust precision and adjustability of the clock while avoiding catastrophic failure.},

	Abstract = {The remarkably stable circadian oscillations of single cyanobacteria enable a population of growing cells to maintain synchrony for weeks. The cyanobacterial pacemaker is a posttranslational regulation (PTR) circuit that generates circadian oscillations in the phosphorylation state of the clock protein KaiC. Layered on top of the PTR is transcriptional-translational feedback regulation (TTR), common to all circadian systems, consisting of a negative feedback loop in which KaiC regulates its own production. We found that the PTR circuit is sufficient to generate oscillations in growing cyanobacteria. However, in the absence of TTR, individual oscillators were less stable and synchrony was not maintained in a population of cells. Experimentally constrained mathematical modeling reproduced sustained oscillations in the PTR circuit alone and demonstrated the importance of TTR for oscillator synchrony.},

These "computational devices of living cells" are responsible for many important cellular processes, including cell-cycle regulation and signal transduction. Here we address the issue of the sensitivity of the networks to variations in their biochemical parameters. We propose a mechanism for robust adaptation in simple signal transduction networks. We show that this mechanism applies in particular to bacterial chemotaxis. This is demonstrated within a quantitative model which explains, in a unified way, many aspects of chemotaxis, including proper responses to chemical gradients. The adaptation property is a consequence of the network's connectivity and does not require the 'fine-tuning' of parameters. We argue that the key properties of biochemical networks should be robust in order to ensure their proper functioning.},

	Abstract = {Precise control of cell proliferation is fundamental to tissue homeostasis and differentiation. Mammalian cells commit to proliferation at the restriction point (R-point). It has long been recognized that the R-point is tightly regulated by the Rb-E2F signaling pathway. Our recent work has further demonstrated that this regulation is mediated by a bistable switch mechanism. Nevertheless, the essential regulatory features in the Rb-E2F pathway that create this switching property have not been defined. Here we analyzed a library of gene circuits comprising all possible link combinations in a simplified Rb-E2F network. We identified a minimal circuit that is able to generate robust, resettable bistability. This minimal circuit contains a feed-forward loop coupled with a mutual-inhibition feedback loop, which forms an AND-gate control of the E2F activation. Underscoring its importance, experimental disruption of this circuit abolishes maintenance of the activated E2F state, supporting its importance for the bistability of the Rb-E2F system. Our findings suggested basic design principles for the robust control of the bistable cell cycle entry at the R-point.},

	Abstract = {The eukaryotic cell cycle is characterized by alternating oscillations in the activities of cyclin-dependent kinase (Cdk) and the anaphase-promoting complex (APC). Successful completion of the cell cycle is dependent on the precise, temporally ordered appearance of these activities. A modest level of Cdk activity is sufficient to initiate DNA replication, but mitosis and APC activation require an elevated Cdk activity. In present-day eukaryotes, this temporal order is provided by a complex network of regulatory proteins that control both Cdk and APC activities via sharp thresholds, bistability, and time delays. Using simple computational models, we show here that these dynamical features of cell-cycle organization could emerge in a control system driven by a single Cdk/cyclin complex and APC wired in a negative-feedback loop. We show that ordered phosphorylation of cellular proteins could be explained by multisite phosphorylation/dephosphorylation and competition of substrates for interconverting kinase (Cdk) and phosphatase. In addition, the competition of APC substrates for ubiquitylation can create and maintain sustained oscillations in cyclin levels. We propose a sequence of models that gets closer and closer to a realistic model of cell-cycle control in yeast. Since these models lack the elaborate control mechanisms characteristic of modern eukaryotes, they suggest that bistability and time delay may have characterized eukaryotic cell divisions before the current cell-cycle control network evolved in all its complexity.},

	Abstract = {Signaling networks have evolved to transduce external and internal information into critical cellular decisions such as growth, differentiation, and apoptosis. These networks form highly interconnected systems within cells due to network crosstalk, where an enzyme from one canonical pathway acts on targets from other pathways. It is currently unclear what types of effects these interconnections can have on the response of networks to incoming signals. In this work, we employ mathematical models to characterize the influence that multiple substrates have on one another. These models build off of the atomistic motif of a kinase/phosphatase pair acting on a single substrate. We find that the ultrasensitive, switch-like response these motifs can exhibit becomes transitive: if one substrate saturates the enzymes and responds ultrasensitively, then all substrates will do so regardless of their degree of saturation. We also demonstrate that the phosphatases themselves can induce crosstalk even when the kinases are independent. These findings have strong implications for how we understand and classify crosstalk, as well as for the rational development of kinase inhibitors aimed at pharmaceutically modulating network behavior.},

	Abstract = {During the past decade, our knowledge of molecular mechanisms involved in growth factor signaling has proliferated almost explosively. However, the kinetics and control of information transfer through signaling networks remain poorly understood. This paper combines experimental kinetic analysis and computational modeling of the short term pattern of cellular responses to epidermal growth factor (EGF) in isolated hepatocytes. The experimental data show transient tyrosine phosphorylation of the EGF receptor (EGFR) and transient or sustained response patterns in multiple signaling proteins targeted by EGFR. Transient responses exhibit pronounced maxima, reached within 15-30 s of EGF stimulation and followed by a decline to relatively low (quasi-steady-state) levels. In contrast to earlier suggestions, we demonstrate that the experimentally observed transients can be accounted for without requiring receptor-mediated activation of specific tyrosine phosphatases, following EGF stimulation. The kinetic model predicts how the cellular response is controlled by the relative levels and activity states of signaling proteins and under what conditions activation patterns are transient or sustained. EGFR signaling patterns appear to be robust with respect to variations in many elemental rate constants within the range of experimentally measured values. On the other hand, we specify which changes in the kinetic scheme, rate constants, and total amounts of molecular factors involved are incompatible with the experimentally observed kinetics of signal transfer. Quantitation of signaling network responses to growth factors allows us to assess how cells process information controlling their growth and differentiation.},

	Abstract = {T-cell proliferation is regulated by the autocrine ligand interleukin-2 (IL-2), for which these cells possess dual, low-affinity and high-affinity receptor populations. Proliferation stimulated by IL-2 is dependent upon ligand binding to p75, a component of the high-affinity receptor. As with other cells exhibiting dual receptor systems, a central question is, therefore: what is the role of the low-affinity receptor population? We apply a mathematical modeling approach to examine three alternative mechanisms that have been suggested for the role of low-affinity receptors: a ligand reservoir, a receptor reservoir, and a ligand carrier. Using model parameter values specific to the IL-2/T-cell system, we find that only the ligand carrier mechanism leads to binding of autocrine ligand to high-affinity receptors that is increased over levels found on a single, pre-formed high-affinity receptor population. With the ligand reservoir and the receptor reservoir mechanisms, the presence of the low-affinity receptors actually diminishes high-affinity receptor binding due to competition. In contrast, excess low-affinity receptors can act to enhance the level of high-affinity receptor complexes when membrane transport is included, indicating that should this mechanism be inhibited, cell response could potentially be reduced or eliminated. The ligand carrier effect is especially significant for cells expressing a large number (> 10(5) receptors/cell) low-affinity receptors, and at low cell densities (< 10(4) cells/ml). This may at least partially account for the behavior demonstrated by early phase adult T-cell leukemia cells.},

Major transitions in these fields were driven by the appearance of the Aiba, Humphrey, and Millis text, Fredrickson's guidance on conceptualizing mathematical representations of cell populations, and Ramkrishna's development of the cybernetic modeling approach. The value of mathematical models to organize data, to consider interactions in complex systems in a rational way, to correct the conventional wisdom, and to understand essential qualitative features of biological systems has been clearly documented in prior research. The impact of this research in biotechnology discovery has so far been limited, but this will change in the future if we are adept in recognizing emerging opportunities and in integrating new concepts and tools into our research. Mathematical structures and methods, allied with extraordinary contemporary computing power, are essential to the emerging field of functional genomics. Important in this quest is a hierarchy of powerful modeling, analysis, and computational tools which can capture essential quantitative features of available experimental data and use these effectively for analysis and design of metabolism.},

	Abstract = {Extracellular cues affect signaling, metabolic, and regulatory processes to elicit cellular responses. Although intracellular signaling, metabolic, and regulatory networks are highly integrated, previous analyses have largely focused on independent processes (e.g., metabolism) without considering the interplay that exists among them. However, there is evidence that many diseases arise from multifunctional components with roles throughout signaling, metabolic, and regulatory networks. Therefore, in this study, we propose a flux balance analysis (FBA)-based strategy, referred to as integrated dynamic FBA (idFBA), that dynamically simulates cellular phenotypes arising from integrated networks. The idFBA framework requires an integrated stoichiometric reconstruction of signaling, metabolic, and regulatory processes. It assumes quasi-steady-state conditions for "fast" reactions and incorporates "slow" reactions into the stoichiometric formalism in a time-delayed manner. To assess the efficacy of idFBA, we developed a prototypic integrated system comprising signaling, metabolic, and regulatory processes with network features characteristic of actual systems and incorporated kinetic parameters based on typical time scales observed in literature. idFBA was applied to the prototypic system, which was evaluated for different environments and gene regulatory rules. In addition, we applied the idFBA framework in a similar manner to a representative module of the single-cell eukaryotic organism Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Ultimately, idFBA facilitated quantitative, dynamic analysis of systemic effects of extracellular cues on cellular phenotypes and generated comparable time-course predictions when contrasted with an equivalent kinetic model. Since idFBA solves a linear programming problem and does not require an exhaustive list of detailed kinetic parameters, it may be efficiently scaled to integrated intracellular systems that incorporate signaling, metabolic, and regulatory processes at the genome scale, such as the S. cerevisiae system presented here.},

	Abstract = {MOTIVATION: The effort to build a whole-cell model requires the development of new modeling approaches, and in particular, the integration of models for different types of processes, each of which may be best described using different representation. Flux-balance analysis (FBA) has been useful for large-scale analysis of metabolic networks, and methods have been developed to incorporate transcriptional regulation (regulatory FBA, or rFBA). Of current interest is the integration of these approaches with detailed models based on ordinary differential equations (ODEs).
RESULTS: We developed an approach to modeling the dynamic behavior of metabolic, regulatory and signaling networks by combining FBA with regulatory Boolean logic, and ordinary differential equations. We use this approach (called integrated FBA, or iFBA) to create an integrated model of Escherichia coli which combines a flux-balance-based, central carbon metabolic and transcriptional regulatory model with an ODE-based, detailed model of carbohydrate uptake control. We compare the predicted Escherichia coli wild-type and single gene perturbation phenotypes for diauxic growth on glucose/lactose and glucose/glucose-6-phosphate with that of the individual models. We find that iFBA encapsulates the dynamics of three internal metabolites and three transporters inadequately predicted by rFBA. Furthermore, we find that iFBA predicts different and more accurate phenotypes than the ODE model for 85 of 334 single gene perturbation simulations, as well for the wild-type simulations. We conclude that iFBA is a significant improvement over the individual rFBA and ODE modeling paradigms.

Using this model, we demonstrate that compartmentalization of the enzymes comprising an engineered pathway for biosynthesis of R-1,2-propanediol leads to improved kinetic properties for the pathway enzymes, especially when substrate diffusivities are low. Our results suggest that enzyme compartmentalization is a powerful approach for improving the catalytic turnover of a channeled carbon substrate and should be particularly useful when applied to synthetic metabolic pathways that suffer from poor translation efficiency, are present in highly variable copy numbers, and have low turnover for new substrates. Furthermore, this approach represents a generic modeling framework for simultaneously analyzing spatial and stochastic events in cellular metabolism and should enable quantitative evaluation of the effect of enzyme compartmentalization on virtually any recombinant pathway.},

	Abstract = {Fumarate hydratase (FH) is an enzyme of the tricarboxylic acid cycle (TCA cycle) that catalyses the hydration of fumarate into malate. Germline mutations of FH are responsible for hereditary leiomyomatosis and renal-cell cancer (HLRCC). It has previously been demonstrated that the absence of FH leads to the accumulation of fumarate, which activates hypoxia-inducible factors (HIFs) at normal oxygen tensions. However, so far no mechanism that explains the ability of cells to survive without a functional TCA cycle has been provided. Here we use newly characterized genetically modified kidney mouse cells in which Fh1 has been deleted, and apply a newly developed computer model of the metabolism of these cells to predict and experimentally validate a linear metabolic pathway beginning with glutamine uptake and ending with bilirubin excretion from Fh1-deficient cells. This pathway, which involves the biosynthesis and degradation of haem, enables Fh1-deficient cells to use the accumulated TCA cycle metabolites and permits partial mitochondrial NADH production. We predicted and confirmed that targeting this pathway would render Fh1-deficient cells non-viable, while sparing wild-type Fh1-containing cells. This work goes beyond identifying a metabolic pathway that is induced in Fh1-deficient cells to demonstrate that inhibition of haem oxygenation is synthetically lethal when combined with Fh1 deficiency, providing a new potential target for treating HLRCC patients.},

	Abstract = {Prediction of metabolic changes that result from genetic or environmental perturbations has several important applications, including diagnosing metabolic disorders and discovering novel drug targets. A cardinal challenge in obtaining accurate predictions is the integration of transcriptional regulatory networks with the corresponding metabolic network. We propose a method called probabilistic regulation of metabolism (PROM) that achieves this synthesis and enables straightforward, automated, and quantitative integration of high-throughput data into constraint-based modeling, making it an ideal tool for constructing genome-scale regulatory-metabolic network models for less-studied organisms. PROM introduces probabilities to represent gene states and gene-transcription factor interactions. By using PROM, we constructed an integrated regulatory-metabolic network for the model organism, Escherichia coli, and demonstrated that our method based on automated inference is more accurate and comprehensive than the current state of the art, which is based on manual curation of literature. After validating the approach, we used PROM to build a genome-scale integrated metabolic-regulatory model for Mycobacterium tuberculosis, a critically important human pathogen. This study incorporated data from more than 1,300 microarrays, 2,000 transcription factor-target interactions regulating 3,300 metabolic reactions, and 1,905 KO phenotypes for E. coli and M. tuberculosis. PROM identified KO phenotypes with accuracies as high as 95%, and predicted growth rates quantitatively with correlation of 0.95. Importantly, PROM represents the successful integration of a top-down reconstructed, statistically inferred regulatory network with a bottom-up reconstructed, biochemically detailed metabolic network, bridging two important classes of systems biology models that are rarely combined quantitatively.},

	Abstract = {Intracellular bacterial pathogens are metabolically adapted to grow within mammalian cells. While these adaptations are fundamental to the ability to cause disease, we know little about the relationship between the pathogen's metabolism and virulence. Here we used an integrative Metabolic Analysis Tool that combines transcriptome data with genome-scale metabolic models to define the metabolic requirements of Listeria monocytogenes during infection. Twelve metabolic pathways were identified as differentially active during L. monocytogenes growth in macrophage cells. Intracellular replication requires de novo synthesis of histidine, arginine, purine, and branch chain amino acids (BCAAs), as well as catabolism of L-rhamnose and glycerol. The importance of each metabolic pathway during infection was confirmed by generation of gene knockout mutants in the respective pathways. Next, we investigated the association of these metabolic requirements in the regulation of L. monocytogenes virulence. Here we show that limiting BCAA concentrations, primarily isoleucine, results in robust induction of the master virulence activator gene, prfA, and the PrfA-regulated genes. This response was specific and required the nutrient responsive regulator CodY, which is known to bind isoleucine. Further analysis demonstrated that CodY is involved in prfA regulation, playing a role in prfA activation under limiting conditions of BCAAs. This study evidences an additional regulatory mechanism underlying L. monocytogenes virulence, placing CodY at the crossroads of metabolism and virulence.},

Current approaches start from the selection of lumped enzyme kinetics and determine the parameters within a large parametric space. However, kinetic parameters are often unknown and obtaining these parameters requires detailed characterization of enzyme kinetics. In many cases, only steady-state fluxes are measured or estimated, but these data have not been utilized to construct dynamic models. Here, we extend the previously developed Ensemble Modeling methodology by allowing various kinetic rate expressions and employing a more efficient solution method for steady states. We show that anchoring the dynamic models to the same flux reduces the allowable parameter space significantly such that sampling of high dimensional kinetic parameters becomes meaningful. The methodology enables examination of the properties of the model's structure, including multiple steady states. Screening of models based on limited steady-state fluxes or metabolite profiles reduces the parameter space further and the remaining models become increasingly predictive. We use both succinate overproduction and central carbon metabolism in Escherichia coli as examples to demonstrate these results.},

Here we present an experimental and computational approach for using dynamic metabolite data to discover allosteric regulation that is relevant in vivo. By switching the culture conditions of Escherichia coli every 30 s between medium containing either pyruvate or (13)C-labeled fructose or glucose, we measured the reversal of flux through glycolysis pathways and observed rapid changes in metabolite concentration. We fit these data to a kinetic model of glycolysis and systematically tested the consequences of 126 putative allosteric interactions on metabolite dynamics. We identified allosteric interactions that govern the reversible switch between gluconeogenesis and glycolysis, including one by which pyruvate activates fructose-1,6-bisphosphatase. Thus, from large sets of putative allosteric interactions, our approach can identify the most likely ones and provide hypotheses about their function.},

	Abstract = {Regulation of metabolic operation in response to extracellular cues is crucial for cells' survival. Next to the canonical nutrient sensors, which measure the concentration of nutrients, recently intracellular "metabolic flux" was proposed as a novel impetus for metabolic regulation. According to this concept, cells would have molecular systems ("flux sensors") in place that regulate metabolism as a function of the actually occurring metabolic fluxes. Although this resembles an appealing concept, we have not had any experimental evidence for the existence of flux sensors and also we have not known how these flux sensors would work in detail. Here, we show experimental evidence that supports the hypothesis that Escherichia coli is indeed able to measure its glycolytic flux and uses this signal for metabolic regulation. Combining experiment and theory, we show how this flux-sensing function could emerge from an aggregate of several molecular mechanisms: First, the system of reactions of lower glycolysis and the feedforward activation of fructose-1,6-bisphosphate on pyruvate kinase translate flux information into the concentration of the metabolite fructose-1,6-bisphosphate. The interaction of this "flux-signaling metabolite" with the transcription factor Cra then leads to flux-dependent regulation. By responding to glycolytic flux, rather than to the concentration of individual carbon sources, the cell may minimize sensing and regulatory expenses.},

	Abstract = {MOTIVATION: In Escherichia coli, the phosphoenolpyruvate: carbohydrate phosphotransferase system acts like a sensory element which is able to measure the flux through glycolysis. Since the output of the sensor, the phosphorylated form of protein EIIA, is connected to the activity of the global transcription factor Crp, the kinetic and structural properties of the system are important for the understanding of the overall cellular behavior.
RESULTS: A family of mathematical models is presented, varying with respect to their degree of complexity (number of reactions that are taken into account, number of parameters) that show a structurally and quantitatively robust behavior. The models describe a set of experimental data that relates the output of the sensor to the specific growth rate. A central element that is responsible for the structural robustness is a feed-forward loop in the glycolysis, namely the activation of the pyruvate kinase reaction by a metabolite of the upper part of the glycolysis. The robustness is shown for variations of the measured data as well as for variations of the parameters.

	Abstract = {The recognition of carbon sources and the regulatory adjustments to recognized changes are of particular importance for bacterial survival in fluctuating environments. Despite a thorough knowledge base of Escherichia coli's central metabolism and its regulation, fundamental aspects of the employed sensing and regulatory adjustment mechanisms remain unclear. In this paper, using a differential equation model that couples enzymatic and transcriptional regulation of E. coli's central metabolism, we show that the interplay of known interactions explains in molecular-level detail the system-wide adjustments of metabolic operation between glycolytic and gluconeogenic carbon sources. We show that these adaptations are enabled by an indirect recognition of carbon sources through a mechanism we termed distributed sensing of intracellular metabolic fluxes. This mechanism uses two general motifs to establish flux-signaling metabolites, whose bindings to transcription factors form flux sensors. As these sensors are embedded in global feedback loop architectures, closed-loop self-regulation can emerge within metabolism itself and therefore, metabolic operation may adapt itself autonomously (not requiring upstream sensing and signaling) to fluctuating carbon sources.},

	Abstract = {Gene expression is regulated by specific transcriptional circuits but also by the global expression machinery as a function of growth. Simultaneous specific and global regulation thus constitutes an additional-but often neglected-layer of complexity in gene expression. Here, we develop an experimental-computational approach to dissect specific and global regulation in the bacterium Escherichia coli. By using fluorescent promoter reporters, we show that global regulation is growth rate dependent not only during steady state but also during dynamic changes in growth rate and can be quantified through two promoter-specific parameters. By applying our approach to arginine biosynthesis, we obtain a quantitative understanding of both specific and global regulation that allows accurate prediction of the temporal response to simultaneous perturbations in arginine availability and growth rate. We thereby uncover two principles of joint regulation: (i) specific regulation by repression dominates the transcriptional response during metabolic steady states, largely repressing the biosynthesis genes even when biosynthesis is required and (ii) global regulation sets the maximum promoter activity that is exploited during the transition between steady states.},

	Abstract = {Biological systems are inherently hierarchal and multiscale in time and space. A major challenge of systems biology is to describe biological systems as a computational model, which can be used to derive novel hypothesis and drive experiments leading to new knowledge. The constraint-based reconstruction and analysis approach has been successfully applied to metabolism and to the macromolecular synthesis machinery assembly. Here, we present the first integrated stoichiometric multiscale model of metabolism and macromolecular synthesis for Escherichia coli K12 MG1655, which describes the sequence-specific synthesis and function of almost 2000 gene products at molecular detail. We added linear constraints, which couple enzyme synthesis and catalysis reactions. Comparison with experimental data showed improvement of growth phenotype prediction with the multiscale model over E. coli's metabolic model alone. Many of the genes covered by this integrated model are well conserved across enterobacters and other, less related bacteria. We addressed the question of whether the bias in synonymous codon usage could affect the growth phenotype and environmental niches that an organism can occupy. We created two classes of in silico strains, one with more biased codon usage and one with more equilibrated codon usage than the wildtype. The reduced growth phenotype in biased strains was caused by tRNA supply shortage, indicating that expansion of tRNA gene content or tRNA codon recognition allow E. coli to respond to changes in codon usage bias. Our analysis suggests that in order to maximize growth and to adapt to new environmental niches, codon usage and tRNA content must co-evolve. These results provide further evidence for the mutation-selection-drift balance theory of codon usage bias. This integrated multiscale reconstruction successfully demonstrates that the constraint-based modeling approach is well suited to whole-cell modeling endeavors.},

	Abstract = {Ordered cardiac morphogenesis and function are essential for all vertebrate life. The heart begins as a simple contractile tube, but quickly grows and morphs into a multichambered pumping organ complete with valves, while maintaining regulation of blood flow and nutrient distribution. Though not identical, cardiac morphogenesis shares many molecular and morphological processes across vertebrate species. Quantitative data across multiple time and length scales have been gathered through decades of reductionist single variable analyses. These range from detailed molecular signaling pathways at the cellular levels to cardiac function at the tissue/organ levels. However, none of these components act in true isolation from others, and each, in turn, exhibits short- and long-range effects in both time and space. With the absence of a gene, entire signaling cascades and genetic profiles may be shifted, resulting in complex feedback mechanisms. Also taking into account local microenvironmental changes throughout development, it is apparent that a systems level approach is an essential resource to accelerate information generation concerning the functional relationships across multiple length scales (molecular data vs physiological function) and structural development. In this review, we discuss relevant in vivo and in vitro experimental approaches, compare different computational frameworks for systems modeling, and the latest information about systems modeling of cardiac development. Finally, we conclude with some important future directions for cardiac systems modeling.},

	Abstract = {Transcription factors that drive non-neoplastic myelomonocytic differentiation are well characterized but have not been systematically analyzed in the leukemic context. We investigated widely used, patient-derived myeloid leukemia cell lines with proclivity for differentiation into granulocytes by retinoic acid (RA) and/or monocytes by 1,25-dihyrdroxyvitamin D3 (D3). Using K562 (FAB M1), HL60 (FAB M2), RA-resistant HL60 sublines, NB4 (FAB M3), and U937 (FAB M5), we correlated nuclear transcription factor expression to immunophenotype, G1/G0 cell cycle arrest and functional inducible oxidative metabolism. We found that myelomonocytic transcription factors are aberrantly expressed in these cell lines. Monocytic-lineage factor EGR1 was not induced by D3 (the monocytic inducer) but instead by RA (the granulocytic inducer) in lineage bipotent myeloblastic HL60. In promyelocytic NB4 cells, EGR1 levels were increased by D3, while Gfi-1 expression (which promotes the granulocytic lineage) was upregulated during D3-induced monocytic differentiation in HL60, and by RA treatment in monocytic U937 cells. Furthermore, RARα and VDR expression were not strongly correlated to differentiation. In response to different differentiation inducers, U937 exhibited the most distinct transcription factor expression profile, while similarly mature NB4 and HL60 were better coupled. Overall, the differentiation induction agents RA and D3 elicited cell-specific responses across these common FAB M1-M5 cell lines.},

	Abstract = {6-Formylindolo(3,2-b)carbazole (FICZ) is a photoproduct of tryptophan and an endogenous high affinity ligand for aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR). It was previously reported that, in patient-derived HL-60 myeloblastic leukemia cells, retinoic acid (RA)-induced differentiation is driven by a signalsome containing c-Cbl and AhR. FICZ enhances RA-induced differentiation, assessed by expression of the membrane differentiation markers CD38 and CD11b, cell cycle arrest and the functional differentiation marker, inducible oxidative metabolism. Moreover, FICZ augments the expression of a number of the members of the RA-induced signalsome, such as c-Cbl, Vav1, Slp76, PI3K, and the Src family kinases Fgr and Lyn. Pursuing the molecular signaling responsible for RA-induced differentiation, we characterized, using FRET and clustering analysis, associations of key molecules thought to drive differentiation. Here we report that, assayed by FRET, AhR interacts with c-Cbl upon FICZ plus RA-induced differentiation, whereas AhR constitutively interacts with Cbl-b. Moreover, correlation analysis based on the flow cytometric assessment of differentiation markers and western blot detection of signaling factors reveal that Cbl-b, p-p38α and pT390-GSK3β, are not correlated with other known RA-induced signaling components or with a phenotypic outcome. We note that FICZ plus RA elicited signaling responses that were not typical of RA alone, but may represent alternative differentiation-driving pathways. In clusters of signaling molecules seminal to cell differentiation, FICZ co-administered with RA augments type and intensity of the dynamic changes induced by RA. Our data suggest relevance for FICZ in differentiation-induction therapy. The mechanism of action includes modulation of a SFK and MAPK centered signalsome and c-Cbl-AhR association.},

	Abstract = {The multivariate nature of cancer necessitates multi-targeted therapy, and kinase inhibitors account for a vast majority of approved cancer therapeutics. While acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL) patients are highly responsive to retinoic acid (RA) therapy, kinase inhibitors have been gaining momentum as co-treatments with RA for non-APL acute myeloid leukemia (AML) differentiation therapies, especially as a means to treat relapsed or refractory AML patients. In this study GW5074 (a c-Raf inhibitor) and PP2 (a Src-family kinase inhibitor) enhanced RA-induced maturation of t(15;17)-negative myeloblastic leukemia cells and rescued response in RA-resistant cells. PD98059 (a MEK inhibitor) and Akti-1/2 (an Akt inhibitor) were less effective, but did tend to promote maturation-uncoupled G1/G0 arrest, while wortmannin (a PI3K inhibitor) did not enhance differentiation surface marker expression or growth arrest. PD98059 and Akti-1/2 did not enhance differentiation markers and have potential, antagonistic off-targets effects on the aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR), but neither could the AhR agonist 6-formylindolo(3,2-b)carbazole (FICZ) rescue differentiation events in the RA-resistant cells. GW5074 rescued early CD38 expression in RA-resistant cells exhibiting an early block in differentiation before CD38 expression, while for RA-resistant cells with differentiation blocked later, PP2 rescued the later differentiation marker CD11b; but surprisingly, the combination of the two was not synergistic. Kinases c-Raf, Src-family kinases Lyn and Fgr, and PI3K display highly correlated signaling changes during RA treatment, while activation of traditional downstream targets (Akt, MEK/ERK), and even the surface marker CD38, were poorly correlated with c-Raf or Lyn during differentiation. This suggests that an interrelated kinase module involving c-Raf, PI3K, Lyn and perhaps Fgr functions in a nontraditional way during RA-induced maturation or during rescue of RA induction therapy using inhibitor co-treatment in RA-resistant leukemia cells.},

	Abstract = {Epithelial to mesenchymal transition (EMT) is an essential differentiation program during tissue morphogenesis and remodeling. EMT is induced by soluble transforming growth factor β (TGF-β) family members, and restricted by vascular endothelial growth factor family members. While many downstream molecular regulators of EMT have been identified, these have been largely evaluated individually without considering potential crosstalk. In this study, we created an ensemble of dynamic mathematical models describing TGF-β induced EMT to better understand the operational hierarchy of this complex molecular program. These models incorporate mass action kinetics within an ordinary differential equation (ODE) framework to describe the transcriptional and post-translational regulatory events driving EMT. Model parameters were estimated from multiple data sets using multiobjective optimization, in combination with cross-validation. TGF-β exposure drove the model population toward a mesenchymal phenotype, while an epithelial phenotype was maintained following vascular endothelial growth factor A (VEGF-A) exposure. Simulations predicted that the transcription factors phosphorylated SP1 and NFAT were master regulators promoting or inhibiting EMT, respectively. Surprisingly, simulations also predicted that a cellular population could exhibit phenotypic heterogeneity (characterized by a significant fraction of the population with both high epithelial and mesenchymal marker expression) if treated simultaneously with TGF-β and VEGF-A. We tested this prediction experimentally in both MCF10A and DLD1 cells and found that upwards of 45\% of the cellular population acquired this hybrid state in the presence of both TGF-β and VEGF-A. We experimentally validated the predicted NFAT/Sp1 signaling axis for each phenotype response. Lastly, we found that cells in the hybrid state had significantly different functional behavior when compared to VEGF-A or TGF-β treatment alone. Together, these results establish a predictive mechanistic model of EMT susceptibility, and potentially reveal a novel signaling axis which regulates carcinoma progression through an EMT versus tubulogenesis response.},

	Abstract = {RNA genetic circuitry is emerging as a powerful tool to control gene expression. However, little work has been done to create a theoretical foundation for RNA circuit design. A prerequisite to this is a quantitative modeling framework that accurately describes the dynamics of RNA circuits. In this work, we develop an ordinary differential equation model of transcriptional RNA genetic circuitry, using an RNA cascade as a test case. We show that parameter sensitivity analysis can be used to design a set of four simple experiments that can be performed in parallel using rapid cell-free transcription-translation (TX-TL) reactions to determine the 13 parameters of the model. The resulting model accurately recapitulates the dynamic behavior of the cascade, and can be easily extended to predict the function of new cascade variants that utilize new elements with limited additional characterization experiments. Interestingly, we show that inconsistencies between model predictions and experiments led to the model-guided discovery of a previously unknown maturation step required for RNA regulator function. We also determine circuit parameters in two different batches of TX-TL, and show that batch-to-batch variation can be attributed to differences in parameters that are directly related to the concentrations of core gene expression machinery. We anticipate the RNA circuit models developed here will inform the creation of computer aided genetic circuit design tools that can incorporate the growing number of RNA regulators, and that the parametrization method will find use in determining functional parameters of a broad array of natural and synthetic regulatory systems.},

	Abstract = {Prostate cancer is the most common cancer in men and the second leading cause of cancer related death in the United States. Androgens, such as testosterone, are required for androgen dependent prostate cancer (ADPC) growth. Androgen ablation in combination with radiation or chemotherapy remains the primary non-surgical treatment for ADPC. However, androgen ablation typically fails to permanently arrest cancer progression, often resulting in castration resistant prostate cancer (CRPC). In this study, we analyzed a population of mathematical models that described the integration of androgen and mitogenic signaling in androgen dependent and independent prostate cancer. An ensemble of model parameters was estimated from 43 studies of signaling in androgen dependent and resistant LNCaP cell lines. The model population was then validated by comparing simulations with an additional 33 data sets from LNCaP cell lines and clinical trials. Analysis of the model population suggested that simultaneously targeting the PI3K and MAPK pathways in addition to anti-androgen therapies could be an effective treatment for CRPC. We tested this hypothesis in both ADPC LNCaP cell lines and LNCaP derived CRPC C4-2 cells using three inhibitors: the androgen receptor inhibitor MDV3100 (enzalutamide), the Raf kinase inhibitor sorafenib, and the PI3K inhibitor LY294002. Consistent with model predictions, cell viability decreased at 72 hrs in the dual and triple inhibition cases in both the LNCaP and C4-2 cell lines, compared to treatment with any single inhibitor. Taken together, this study suggested that crosstalk between the androgen and mitogenic signaling axes led to robustness of CRPC to any single inhibitor.

	Abstract = {OBJECTIVE: We sought to develop an intensive care unit research database applying automated techniques to aggregate high-resolution diagnostic and therapeutic data from a large, diverse population of adult intensive care unit patients. This freely available database is intended to support epidemiologic research in critical care medicine and serve as a resource to evaluate new clinical decision support and monitoring algorithms.
DESIGN: Data collection and retrospective analysis.
SETTING: All adult intensive care units (medical intensive care unit, surgical intensive care unit, cardiac care unit, cardiac surgery recovery unit) at a tertiary care hospital.
PATIENTS: Adult patients admitted to intensive care units between 2001 and 2007.
INTERVENTIONS: None.
MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: The Multiparameter Intelligent Monitoring in Intensive Care II (MIMIC-II) database consists of 25,328 intensive care unit stays. The investigators collected detailed information about intensive care unit patient stays, including laboratory data, therapeutic intervention profiles such as vasoactive medication drip rates and ventilator settings, nursing progress notes, discharge summaries, radiology reports, provider order entry data, International Classification of Diseases, 9th Revision codes, and, for a subset of patients, high-resolution vital sign trends and waveforms. Data were automatically deidentified to comply with Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act standards and integrated with relational database software to create electronic intensive care unit records for each patient stay. The data were made freely available in February 2010 through the Internet along with a detailed user's guide and an assortment of data processing tools. The overall hospital mortality rate was 11.7%, which varied by critical care unit. The median intensive care unit length of stay was 2.2 days (interquartile range, 1.1-4.4 days). According to the primary International Classification of Diseases, 9th Revision codes, the following disease categories each comprised at least 5% of the case records: diseases of the circulatory system (39.1%); trauma (10.2%); diseases of the digestive system (9.7%); pulmonary diseases (9.0%); infectious diseases (7.0%); and neoplasms (6.8%).
CONCLUSIONS: MIMIC-II documents a diverse and very large population of intensive care unit patient stays and contains comprehensive and detailed clinical data, including physiological waveforms and minute-by-minute trends for a subset of records. It establishes a new public-access resource for critical care research, supporting a diverse range of analytic studies spanning epidemiology, clinical decision-rule development, and electronic tool development.},

Following our previous efforts with the MIMIC (Multi-parameter Intelligent Monitoring for Intensive Care) Database, we have leveraged advances in networking and storage technologies to develop a far more massive temporal database, MIMIC II. MIMIC II is an ongoing effort: data is continuously and prospectively archived from all ICU patients in our hospital. MIMIC II now consists of over 800 ICU patient records including over 120 gigabytes of data and is growing. A customized archiving system was used to store continuously up to four waveforms and 30 different parameters from ICU patient monitors. An integrated user-friendly relational database was developed for browsing of patients' clinical information (lab results, fluid balance, medications, nurses' progress notes). Based upon its unprecedented size and scope, MIMIC II will prove to be an important resource for intelligent patient monitoring research, and will support efforts in medical data mining and knowledge-discovery.},

	Abstract = {The critical state of intensive care unit (ICU) patients demands close monitoring, and as a result a large volume of multi-parameter data is collected continuously. This represents a unique opportunity for researchers interested in clinical data mining. We sought to foster a more transparent and efficient intensive care research community by building a publicly available ICU database, namely Multiparameter Intelligent Monitoring in Intensive Care II (MIMIC-II). The data harnessed in MIMIC-II were collected from the ICUs of Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center from 2001 to 2008 and represent 26,870 adult hospital admissions (version 2.6). MIMIC-II consists of two major components: clinical data and physiological waveforms. The clinical data, which include patient demographics, intravenous medication drip rates, and laboratory test results, were organized into a relational database. The physiological waveforms, including 125 Hz signals recorded at bedside and corresponding vital signs, were stored in an open-source format. MIMIC-II data were also deidentified in order to remove protected health information. Any interested researcher can gain access to MIMIC-II free of charge after signing a data use agreement and completing human subjects training. MIMIC-II can support a wide variety of research studies, ranging from the development of clinical decision support algorithms to retrospective clinical studies. We anticipate that MIMIC-II will be an invaluable resource for intensive care research by stimulating fair comparisons among different studies.},

	Abstract = {BACKGROUND: Warfarin is routinely used in the prevention and treatment of prothrombotic events. During initiation of warfarin therapy levels of factor (F) VII and protein C decrease rapidly but prothrombin, FIX and FX decline much slower. Therefore, propagation of thrombin generation (TG) remains unaffected much longer, increasing the risk of inadequate anticoagulation. Recently, a novel agent, anti-IXa aptamer, RB006, has been developed. Therefore, we have evaluated the in vitro effects of this agent in warfarin plasma.
METHODS: The investigation consisted of two parts. First, a computer simulated time course of TG with warfarin alone and in combination with FIXa inhibition was evaluated and, second, normal volunteer, protein C deficient, FVII deficient and commercial warfarin plasmas (INR 2.1 and 3.1) were spiked with increasing concentrations of aptamer (0-24 microg/ml) and its anticoagulant effects were evaluated using prothrombin time (PT), activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT) and TG with tissue factor and Actin as activators. Direct effects of aptamer on protein C were also evaluated.
RESULTS: Simulation of coagulation during warfarin induction showed that TG can be significantly delayed and decreased by inhibiting FIXa (i.e., with anti-FIXa aptamer). The anti-FIXa aptamer inhibited TG in all tested plasmas, but was most efficacious in warfarin and FVII deficient plasma. The aptamer itself did not inhibit protein C and had no effect on PT, but concentration-dependently increased aPTT.
CONCLUSION: The anti-FIXa aptamer potentiates the inhibitory effects of warfarin on TG, and may fill the need as an adjuvant agent during initiation of warfarin therapy.},

Inflammatory cytokines are the major mediators involved in coagulation activation. The natural anticoagulants function to dampen elevation of cytokine levels. Furthermore, components of the natural anticoagulant cascades, like thrombomodulin, minimise endothelial cell dysfunction by rendering the cells less responsive to inflammatory mediators, facilitate the neutralisation of some inflammatory mediators and decrease loss of endothelial barrier function. Hence, downregulation of anticoagulant pathways not only promotes thrombosis but also amplifies the inflammatory process. When the inflammation-coagulation interactions overwhelm the natural defence systems, catastrophic events occur, such as manifested in severe sepsis or inflammatory bowel disease.},

	Abstract = {The traditional view of injuries as "accidents", or random events, has resulted in the historical neglect of this area of public health. However, the most recent estimates show that injuries are among the leading causes of death and disability in the world. They affect all populations, regardless of age, sex, income, or geographic region. In 1998, about 5.8 million people (97.9 per 100,000 population) died of injuries worldwide, and injuries caused 16% of the global burden of disease. Road traffic injuries are the 10th leading cause of death and the 9th leading cause of the burden of disease; self-inflicted injuries, falls, and interpersonal violence follow closely. Injuries affect mostly young people, often causing long-term disability. Decreasing the burden of injuries is among the main challenges for public health in the next century--injuries are preventable, and many effective strategies are available. Public health officials must gain a better understanding of the magnitude and characteristics of the problem, contribute to the development and evaluation of injury prevention programs, and develop the best possible prehospital and hospital care and rehabilitation for injured persons.},

	Abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To find a predictive model for postinjury multiple organ failure (MOF).
DESIGN: A 3-year cohort study ending December 1992 (first year: retrospective; last 2 years: prospective).
SETTING: Denver General Hospital (Colo) is a regional level I trauma center.
PATIENTS: Consecutive trauma patients with an Injury Severity Score (ISS) greater than 15, with an age greater than 16 years, and who survived longer than 24 hours. Stepwise logistic regression analysis was performed in all patients (n = 394), in the subgroup of patients with 0 to 12 hours, plus 12 to 24 hours base deficit (BD) results (n = 220), and in a second subgroup of patients with BD plus lactate results at 0 to 12 hours and 12 to 24 hours (n = 106).
MAIN OUTCOME: Postinjury MOF.
RESULTS: The following variables were identified as independent predictors of MOF in the analysis of all patients: age more than 55 years, ISS greater than or equal to 25, and more than 6 U of red blood cells in the first 12 hours after admission (U RBC/12 hours). In the subgroup with BD results, the same analysis identified age greater than 55 years, greater than 6 U RBC/12 hours, and BD greater than 8 mEq/L (0 to 12 hours), while in the last subgroup analysis including BD and lactate results, greater than 6 U RBC/12 hours, BD greater than 8 mEq/L (0 to 12 hours), and lactate greater than 2.5 mmol/L (12 to 24 hours) were independently associated with MOF.
CONCLUSIONS: Age greater than 55 years, ISS greater than or equal to 25, and greater than 6 U RBC/12 hours are early independent predictors of MOF. Subgroup analyses indicate that BD and lactate levels may add substantial predictive value. Moreover, these results emphasize the predominant role of the initial insult in the pathogenesis of postinjury MOF.},

	Abstract = {OBJECTIVE: Recognizing the impact of the 1977 San Francisco study of trauma deaths in trauma care, our purpose was to reassess those findings in a contemporary trauma system.
DESIGN: Cross-sectional.
MATERIAL AND METHODS: All trauma deaths occurring in Denver City and County during 1992 were reviewed; data were obtained by cross-referencing four databases: paramedic trip reports, trauma registries, coroner autopsy reports and police reports.
MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: There were 289 postinjury fatalities; mean age was 36.8 +/- 1.2 years and mean Injury Severity Score (ISS) was 35.7 +/- 1.2. Predominant injury mechanisms were gunshot wounds in 121 (42%), motorvehicle accidents in 75 (38%) and falls in 23 (8%) cases. Seven (2%) individuals sustained lethal burns. Ninety eight (34%) deaths occurred in the pre-hospital setting. The remaining 191 (66%) patients were transported to the hospital. Of these, 154 (81%) died in the first 48 hours (acute), 11 (6%) within three to seven days (early) and 26 (14%) after seven days (late). Central nervous system injuries were the most frequent cause of death (42%), followed by exsanguination (39%) and organ failure (7%). While acute and early deaths were mostly due to the first two causes, organ failure was the most common cause of late death (61%).
CONCLUSIONS: In comparison with the previous report, we observed similar injury mechanisms, demographics and causes of death. However, in our experience, there was an improved access to the medical system, greater proportion of late deaths due to brain injury and lack of the classic trimodal distribution.},

	Abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To determine if blood transfusion is a consistent risk factor for postinjury multiple organ failure (MOF), independent of other shock indexes.
DESIGN: A 55-month inception cohort study ending on August 30, 1995. Data characterizing postinjury MOF were prospectively collected. Multiple logistic regression analysis was performed on 5 sets of data. Set 1 included admission data (age, sex, comorbidity, injury mechanism, Glasgow Coma Scale, Injury Severity Score, and systolic blood pressure determined in the emergency department) plus the amount of blood transfused within the first 12 hours. In the subsequent 4 data sets, other indexes of shock (early base deficit, early lactate level, late base deficit, and late lactate level) were sequentially added. Additionally, the same multiple logistic regression analyses were performed with early MOF and late MOF as the outcome variables.
SETTING: Denver General Hospital, Denver, Colo, is a regional level I trauma center.
PATIENTS: Five hundred thirteen consecutive trauma patients admitted to the trauma intensive care unit with an Injury Severity Score greater than 15 who were older than 16 years and who survived longer than 48 hours.
INTERVENTIONS: None.
MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: The relationship of blood transfusions and other shock indexes with the outcome variable, MOF.
RESULTS: A dose-response relationship between early blood transfusion and the later development of MOF was identified. Despite the inclusion of other indexes of shock, blood transfusion was identified as an independent risk factor in 13 of the 15 multiple logistic regression models tested; the odds ratios were high, especially in the early MOF models.

	Abstract = {Flux balance models of metabolism use stoichiometry of metabolic pathways, metabolic demands of growth, and optimality principles to predict metabolic flux distribution and cellular growth under specified environmental conditions. These models have provided a mechanistic interpretation of systemic metabolic physiology, and they are also useful as a quantitative tool for metabolic pathway design. Quantitative predictions of cell growth and metabolic by-product secretion that are experimentally testable can be obtained from these models. In the present report, we used independent measurements to determine the model parameters for the wild-type Escherichia coli strain W3110. We experimentally determined the maximum oxygen utilization rate (15 mmol of O2 per g [dry weight] per h), the maximum aerobic glucose utilization rate (10.5 mmol of Glc per g [dry weight] per h), the maximum anaerobic glucose utilization rate (18.5 mmol of Glc per g [dry weight] per h), the non-growth-associated maintenance requirements (7.6 mmol of ATP per g [dry weight] per h), and the growth-associated maintenance requirements (13 mmol of ATP per g of biomass). The flux balance model specified by these parameters was found to quantitatively predict glucose and oxygen uptake rates as well as acetate secretion rates observed in chemostat experiments. We have formulated a predictive algorithm in order to apply the flux balance model to describe unsteady-state growth and by-product secretion in aerobic batch, fed-batch, and anaerobic batch cultures. In aerobic experiments we observed acetate secretion, accumulation in the culture medium, and reutilization from the culture medium. In fed-batch cultures acetate is cometabolized with glucose during the later part of the culture period.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)},

The concept of 'elementary flux modes' provides a mathematical tool to define and comprehensively describe all metabolic routes that are both stoichiometrically and thermodynamically feasible for a group of enzymes. We have used this concept to analyze the interplay between the pentose phosphate pathway (PPP) and glycolysis. The set of elementary modes for this system involves conventional glycolysis, a futile cycle, all the modes of PPP function described in biochemistry textbooks, and additional modes that are a priori equally entitled to pathway status. Applications include maximizing product yield in amino acid and antibiotic synthesis, reconstruction and consistency checks of metabolism from genome data, analysis of enzyme deficiencies, and drug target identification in metabolic networks.},

	Abstract = {Cellular metabolism is most often described and interpreted in terms of the biochemical reactions that make up the metabolic network. Genomics is providing near complete information regarding the genes/gene products participating in cellular metabolism for a growing number of organisms. As the true functional units of metabolic systems are its pathways, the time has arrived to define metabolic pathways in the context of whole-cell metabolism for the analysis of the structural design and capabilities of the metabolic network. In this study, we present the theoretical foundations for the identification of the unique set of systemically independent biochemical pathways, termed extreme pathways, based on system stochiometry and limited thermodynamics. These pathways represent the edges of the steady-state flux cone derived from convex analysis, and they can be used to represent any flux distribution achievable by the metabolic network. An algorithm is presented to determine the set of extreme pathways for a system of any complexity and a classification scheme is introduced for the characterization of these pathways. The property of systemic independence is discussed along with its implications for issues related to metabolic regulation and the evolution of cellular metabolic networks. The underlying pathway structure that is determined from the set of extreme pathways now provides us with the ability to analyse, interpret, and perhaps predict metabolic function from a pathway-based perspective in addition to the traditional reaction-based perspective. The algorithm and classification scheme developed can be used to describe the pathway structure in annotated genomes to explore the capabilities of an organism.},

	Abstract = {Flux Balance Analysis (FBA) has been used in the past to analyze microbial metabolic networks. Typically, \{FBA\} is used to study the metabolic flux at a particular steady state of the system. However, there are many situations where the reprogramming of the metabolic network is important. Therefore, the dynamics of these metabolic networks have to be studied. In this paper, we have extended \{FBA\} to account for dynamics and present two different formulations for dynamic FBA. These two approaches were used in the analysis of diauxic growth in Escherichia coli. Dynamic \{FBA\} was used to simulate the batch growth of E. coli on glucose, and the predictions were found to qualitatively match experimental data. The dynamic \{FBA\} formalism was also used to study the sensitivity to the objective function. It was found that an instantaneous objective function resulted in better predictions than a terminal-type objective function. The constraints that govern the growth at different phases in the batch culture were also identified. Therefore, dynamic \{FBA\} provides a framework for analyzing the transience of metabolism due to metabolic reprogramming and for obtaining insights for the design of metabolic networks.},

@article{Wiback:2003aa,
	Abstract = {The move towards genome-scale analysis of cellular functions has necessitated the development of analytical (in silico) methods to understand such large and complex biochemical reaction networks. One such method is extreme pathway analysis that uses stoichiometry and thermodynamic irreversibly to define mathematically unique, systemic metabolic pathways. These extreme pathways form the edges of a high-dimensional convex cone in the flux space that contains all the attainable steady state solutions, or flux distributions, for the metabolic network. By definition, any steady state flux distribution can be described as a nonnegative linear combination of the extreme pathways. To date, much effort has been focused on calculating, defining, and understanding these extreme pathways. However, little work has been performed to determine how these extreme pathways contribute to a given steady state flux distribution. This study represents an initial effort aimed at defining how physiological steady state solutions can be reconstructed from a network's extreme pathways. In general, there is not a unique set of nonnegative weightings on the extreme pathways that produce a given steady state flux distribution but rather a range of possible values. This range can be determined using linear optimization to maximize and minimize the weightings of a particular extreme pathway in the reconstruction, resulting in what we have termed the alpha-spectrum. The alpha-spectrum defines which extreme pathways can and cannot be included in the reconstruction of a given steady state flux distribution and to what extent they individually contribute to the reconstruction. It is shown that accounting for transcriptional regulatory constraints can considerably shrink the alpha-spectrum. The alpha-spectrum is computed and interpreted for two cases; first, optimal states of a skeleton representation of core metabolism that include transcriptional regulation, and second for human red blood cell metabolism under various physiological, non-optimal conditions.},

	Abstract = {Metabolic engineering is the field of introducing genetic changes in organisms so as to modify their function towards synthesizing new products of high impact to society. However, engineered cells frequently have impaired growth rates thus seriously limiting the rate at which such products are made. The problem is attributable to inadequate understanding of how a metabolic network functions in a dynamic sense. Predictions of mutant strain behavior in the past have been based on steady state theories such as flux balance analysis (FBA), minimization of metabolic adjustment (MOMA), and regulatory on/off minimization (ROOM). Such predictions are restricted to product yields and cannot address productivity, which is of focal interest to applications. We demonstrate that our framework ( [Song and Ramkrishna, 2010] and [Song and Ramkrishna, 2011]), based on a ``cybernetic'' view of metabolic systems, makes predictions of the dynamic behavior of mutant strains of Escherichia coli from a limited amount of data obtained from the wild-type. Dynamic frameworks must necessarily address the issue of metabolic regulation, which the cybernetic approach does by postulating that metabolism is an optimal dynamic response of the organism to the environment in driving reactions towards ensuring survival. The predictions made in this paper are without parallel in the literature and lay the foundation for rational metabolic engineering.},

@article{Julia,
	Abstract = {The Julia programming language is gaining enormous popularity. Julia was designed to be easy and fast. Most importantly, Julia shatters deeply established notions widely held in the applied community:

1. High-level, dynamic code has to be slow by some sort of law of nature.
2. It is sensible to prototype in one language and then recode in another language.
3. There are parts of a system for the programmer, and other parts best left untouched as they are built by the experts.

Julia began with a deep understanding of the needs of the scientific programmer and the needs of the computer in mind. Bridging cultures that have often been distant, Julia combines expertise from computer science and computational science creating a new approach to scientific computing. This note introduces the programmer to the language and the underlying design theory. It invites the reader to rethink the fundamental foundations of numerical computing systems.

In particular, there is the fascinating dance between specialization and abstraction. Specialization allows for custom treatment. We can pick just the right algorithm for the right circumstance and this can happen at runtime based on argument types (code selection via multiple dispatch). Abstraction recognizes what remains the same after differences are stripped away and ignored as irrelevant. The recognition of abstraction allows for code reuse (generic programming). A simple idea that yields incredible power. The Julia design facilitates this interplay in many explicit and subtle ways for machine performance and, most importantly, human convenience.},

This problem is stated as a nonlinear programming (NLP) problem subject to nonlinear differential-algebraic constraints. There problems are known to be frequently ill-conditioned and multimodal. Thus, traditional (gradient-based) local optimization methods fail to arrive at satisfactory solutions. To surmount this limitation, the use of several state-of-the-art deterministic and stochastic global optimization method is explored. A case study considering the estimation of 36 parameters of a nonlinear biochemical dynamic model is taken as a benchmark. Only a certain type of stochastic algorithm, evolution strategies (ES), is able to solve this problem successfully.  Although these stochastic methods cannot guarantee global optimality with certainty, their robustness, plus the fact that in inverse problems they have a known lower bound for the cost function, make them the best available candidates.},

These systems have large numbers of poorly known parameters, simplified dynamics, and uncertain connectivity: three key features of a class of problems we call sloppy models, which are shared by many other high-dimensional multiparameter nonlinear models. We use a statistical ensemble method to study the behavior of there models, in order to extract as much useful predictive information as possible from a sloppy model, given the available data used to contrain it. We discuss numerical challenges that emerge in using the ensemble method for a large systems. We characterize features of sloppy model parameter fluctuations by various spectral decompositions and find indeed that five parameters can be used to fit an elephant. We also find that model entropy is as important to the problem of model choice as model energy is to parameter choice.},

	Abstract = {The inherent complexity of cellular signaling networks and their importance to a wide range of cellular functions necessiates the development of modeling methods that can be applied toward making predictions and highlighting the appropriate experiments to test our understanding of how these systems are designed and function. We use methods of statistical mechnics to extract useful predictions for complex cellular signaling metworks. A key difficulty with signaling models is that, while significant effort is being made to experimentally measure the rate constants for indivisual steps in these networks, many of the parameters required to describe their behaviour remain unknown or at best represent estimates. To establish the usefulness of our approach, we have applied our methods toward modeling the nerve growth factor (NGF)-induced differentiation of neuronal cells. In particular, we study the actions of NGF and mitogenic epidermal growth factor (EGF) in rat pheochromocytoma (PC12) cells. Through a network of intermediate signaling proteins, each of these growth factors stimulates extracellular regulated kinase (Erk) phosphorylation with distinct dynamical profiles. Using our modeling approach, we are able to predict the influence of specific signaling modules in determining the intergrated cellular response to the two growth factors. Our methods also raise some interesting insights into the design and possible evolution of cellular systems, highlighting an inherent property of these systems that we call 'sloppiness'.},

	Abstract = {Advances in molecular biology provide an opportunity to develop detailed models of biological processes that can be used to obtain an integrated understanding of the system. However, development of useful models from the available knowledge of the system and experimental observations still remains a daunting task. In this work, a model identification strategy for complex biological networks is proposed. The approach includes a state regulator problem (SRP) that provides estimates of all the component concentrations and the reaction rates of the network using the available measurements. The full set of the estimates is utilised for model parameter identification for the network of known topology. An a priori model complexity test that indicates the feasibility of performance of the proposed algorithm is developed. Fisher information matrix (FIM) theory is used to address model identifiability issues. Two signalling pathway case studies, the caspase function in apoptosis and the MAP kinase cascade system, are considered. The MAP kinase cascade, with measurements restricted to protein complex concentrations, fails the a priori test and the SRP estimates are poor as expected. The apoptosis network structure used in this work has moderate complexity and is suitable for application of the proposed tools. Using a measurement set of seven protein concentrations, accurate estimates for all unknowns are obtained. Furthermore, the effects of measurement sampling frequency and quality of information in the measurement set on the performance of the identified model are described.},

Even under such high uncertainty, we show here that ensemble modeling, when combined with targeted experimental analysis, can unravel key operating principles in complex cellular pathways. For proof of concept, we develop a library of mechanistically alternative dynamic models for the highly conserved target-of-rapamycin (TOR) pathway of Saccharomyces cerevisiae. In contrast to the prevailing view of a de novo assembly of type 2A phosphatases (PP2As), our integrated computational and experimental analysis proposes a specificity factor, based on Tap42p-Tip41p, for PP2As as the key signaling mechanism that is quantitatively consistent with all available experimental data. Beyond revisiting our picture of TOR signaling, we expect ensemble modeling to help elucidate other insufficiently characterized cellular circuits.},

	Abstract = {MOTIVATION: In recent years, the biological literature has seen a significant increase of reported methods for identifying both structure and parameters of ordinary differential equations (ODEs) from time series data. A natural way to evaluate the performance of such methods is to try them on a sufficient number of realistic test cases. However, weak practices in specifying identification problems and lack of commonly accepted benchmark problems makes it difficult to evaluate and compare different methods. RESULTS: To enable better evaluation and comparisons between different methods, we propose how to specify identification problems as optimization problems with a model space of allowed reactions (e.g. reaction kinetics like Michaelis-Menten or S-systems), ranges for the parameters, time series data and an error function. We also define a file format for such problems. We then present a collection of more than 40 benchmark problems for ODE model identification of cellular systems. The collection includes realistic problems of different levels of difficulty w.r.t. size and quality of data. We consider both problems with simulated data from known systems, and problems with real data. Finally, we present results based on our identification algorithm for all benchmark problems. In comparison with publications on which we have based some of the benchmark problems, our approach allows all problems to be solved without the use of supercomputing. AVAILABILITY: The benchmark problems are available at www.odeidentification.org. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.},

@article{Purvis:2009qq,
	Abstract = {A defining characteristic of living cells is the ability to respond dynamically to external stimuli while maintaining homeostasis under resting conditions. Capturing both of these features in a single kinetic model is difficult because the model must be able to reproduce both behaviors using the same set of molecular components. Here, we show how combining small, well-defined steady-state networks provides an efficient means of constructing large-scale kinetic models that exhibit realistic resting and dynamic behaviors. By requiring each kinetic module to be homeostatic (at steady state under resting conditions), the method proceeds by (i) computing steady-state solutions to a system of ordinary differential equations for each module, (ii) applying principal component analysis to each set of solutions to capture the steady-state solution space of each module network, and (iii) combining optimal search directions from all modules to form a global steady-state space that is searched for accurate simulation of the time-dependent behavior of the whole system upon perturbation. Importantly, this stepwise approach retains the nonlinear rate expressions that govern each reaction in the system and enforces constraints on the range of allowable concentration states for the full-scale model. These constraints not only reduce the computational cost of fitting experimental time-series data but can also provide insight into limitations on system concentrations and architecture. To demonstrate application of the method, we show how small kinetic perturbations in a modular model of platelet P2Y(1) signaling can cause widespread compensatory effects on cellular resting states.},

	Abstract = {The role of mechanistic modeling and systems biology in molecular medicine remains unclear. In this study, we explored whether uncertain models could be used to understand how a network responds to a therapeutic intervention. As a proof of concept, we modeled and analyzed the response of the human coagulation cascade to recombinant factor VIIa (rFVIIa) and prothrombin (fII) addition in normal and hemophilic plasma. An ensemble of parametrically uncertain human coagulation models was developed (N = 437). Each model described the time evolution of 193 proteins and protein complexes interconnected by 301 interactions under quiescent flow. The 467 unknown model parameters were estimated, using multiobjective optimization, from published in vitro coagulation studies. The model ensemble was validated using published in vitro thrombin measurements and thrombin measurements taken from coronary artery disease patients. Sensitivity analysis was then used to rank-order the importance of model parameters as a function of experimental or physiological conditions. A novel strategy for the systematic comparison of ranks identified a family of fX/FXa and fII/FIIa interactions that became more sensitive with decreasing fVIII/fIX. The fragility of these interactions was preserved following the addition of exogenous rFVIIa and fII. This suggested that exogenous rFVIIa did not alter the qualitative operation of the cascade. Rather, exogenous rFVIIa and fII took advantage of existing fluid and interfacial fX/FXa and fII/FIIa sensitivity to restore normal coagulation in low fVIII/fIX conditions. The proposed rFVIIa mechanism of action was consistent with experimental literature not used in model training. Thus, we demonstrated that an ensemble of uncertain models could unravel key facets of the mechanism of action of a focused intervention. Whereas the current study was limited to coagulation, perhaps the general strategy used could be extended to other molecular networks relevant to human health.},

	Abstract = {Dynamic models of metabolism are instrumental for gaining insight and predicting possible outcomes of perturbations. Current approaches start from the selection of lumped enzyme kinetics and determine the parameters within a large parametric space. However, kinetic parameters are often unknown and obtaining these parameters requires detailed characterization of enzyme kinetics. In many cases, only steady-state fluxes are measured or estimated, but these data have not been utilized to construct dynamic models. Here, we extend the previously developed Ensemble Modeling methodology by allowing various kinetic rate expressions and employing a more efficient solution method for steady states. We show that anchoring the dynamic models to the same flux reduces the allowable parameter space significantly such that sampling of high dimensional kinetic parameters becomes meaningful. The methodology enables examination of the properties of the model's structure, including multiple steady states. Screening of models based on limited steady-state fluxes or metabolite profiles reduces the parameter space further and the remaining models become increasingly predictive. We use both succinate overproduction and central carbon metabolism in Escherichia coli as examples to demonstrate these results.},

	Abstract = {A hallmark of severe sepsis is systemic inflammation which activates leukocytes and can result in their misdirection. This leads to both impaired migration to the locus of infection and increased infiltration into healthy tissues. In order to better understand the pathophysiologic mechanisms involved, we developed a coarse-grained phenomenological model of the acute inflammatory response in CLP (cecal ligation and puncture)-induced sepsis in rats. This model incorporates distinct neutrophil kinetic responses to the inflammatory stimulus and the dynamic interactions between components of a compartmentalized inflammatory response. Ensembles of model parameter sets consistent with experimental observations were statistically generated using a Markov-Chain Monte Carlo sampling. Prediction uncertainty in the model states was quantified over the resulting ensemble parameter sets. Forward simulation of the parameter ensembles successfully captured experimental features and predicted that systemically activated circulating neutrophils display impaired migration to the tissue and neutrophil sequestration in the lung, consequently contributing to tissue damage and mortality. Principal component and multiple regression analyses of the parameter ensembles estimated from survivor and non-survivor cohorts provide insight into pathologic mechanisms dictating outcome in sepsis. Furthermore, the model was extended to incorporate hypothetical mechanisms by which immune modulation using extracorporeal blood purification results in improved outcome in septic rats. Simulations identified a sub-population (about 18% of the treated population) that benefited from blood purification. Survivors displayed enhanced neutrophil migration to tissue and reduced sequestration of lung neutrophils, contributing to improved outcome. The model ensemble presented herein provides a platform for generating and testing hypotheses in silico, as well as motivating further experimental studies to advance understanding of the complex biological response to severe infection, a problem of growing magnitude in humans.},

	Abstract = {Previous mathematical modeling efforts have made significant contributions to the development of systems biology for predicting biological behavior quantitatively. However, dynamic metabolic model construction remains challenging due to uncertainties in mechanistic structures and parameters. In addition, parameter estimation and model validation often require designated experiments conducted only for purpose of modeling. Such difficulties have hampered the progress of modeling in biology and biotechnology. To circumvent these problems, ensemble approaches have been used to account for uncertainties in model structure and parameters. Specifically, this review focuses on approaches that utilize readily available fermentation data for parameter screening and model validation. Time course data for metabolite measurements, if available, can further calibrate the model. The basis for this approach is explained in non-mathematical terms accessible to experimentalists. Information gained from such an approach has been shown to be useful in designing Escherichia coli strains for metabolic engineering and synthetic biology.},

	Abstract = {In contrast to stoichiometric-based models, the development of large-scale kinetic models of metabolism has been hindered by the challenge of identifying kinetic parameter values and kinetic rate laws applicable to a wide range of environmental and/or genetic perturbations. The recently introduced ensemble modeling (EM) procedure provides a promising remedy to address these challenges by decomposing metabolic reactions into elementary reaction steps and incorporating all phenotypic observations, upon perturbation, in its model parameterization scheme. Here, we present a kinetic model of Escherichia coli core metabolism that satisfies the fluxomic data for wild-type and seven mutant strains by making use of the EM concepts. This model encompasses 138 reactions, 93 metabolites and 60 substrate-level regulatory interactions accounting for glycolysis/gluconeogenesis, pentose phosphate pathway, TCA cycle, major pyruvate metabolism, anaplerotic reactions and a number of reactions in other parts of the metabolism. Parameterization is performed using a formal optimization approach that minimizes the discrepancies between model predictions and flux measurements. The predicted fluxes by the model are within the uncertainty range of experimental flux data for 78% of the reactions (with measured fluxes) for both the wild-type and seven mutant strains. The remaining flux predictions are mostly within three standard deviations of reported ranges. Converting the EM-based parameters into a Michaelis-Menten equivalent formalism revealed that 35% of Km and 77% of kcat parameters are within uncertainty range of the literature-reported values. The predicted metabolite concentrations by the model are also within uncertainty ranges of metabolomic data for 68% of the metabolites. A leave-one-out cross-validation test to evaluate the flux prediction performance of the model showed that metabolic fluxes for the mutants located in the proximity of mutations used for training the model can be predicted more accurately. The constructed model and the parameterization procedure presented in this study pave the way for the construction of larger-scale kinetic models with more narrowly distributed parameter values as new metabolomic/fluxomic data sets are becoming available for E. coli and other organisms.},

	Abstract = {Metabolic pathways in cells must be sufficiently robust to tolerate fluctuations in expression levels and changes in environmental conditions. Perturbations in expression levels may lead to system failure due to the disappearance of a stable steady state. Increasing evidence has suggested that biological networks have evolved such that they are intrinsically robust in their network structure. In this article, we presented Ensemble Modeling for Robustness Analysis (EMRA), which combines a continuation method with the Ensemble Modeling approach, for investigating the robustness issue of non-native pathways. EMRA investigates a large ensemble of reference models with different parameters, and determines the effects of parameter drifting until a bifurcation point, beyond which a stable steady state disappears and system failure occurs. A pathway is considered to have high bifurcational robustness if the probability of system failure is low in the ensemble. To demonstrate the utility of EMRA, we investigate the bifurcational robustness of two synthetic central metabolic pathways that achieve carbon conservation: non-oxidative glycolysis and reverse glyoxylate cycle. With EMRA, we determined the probability of system failure of each design and demonstrated that alternative designs of these pathways indeed display varying degrees of bifurcational robustness. Furthermore, we demonstrated that target selection for flux improvement should consider the trade-offs between robustness and performance.},

	Abstract = {Accurate determination of physiological states of cellular metabolism requires detailed information about metabolic fluxes, metabolite concentrations and distribution of enzyme states. Integration of fluxomics and metabolomics data, and thermodynamics-based metabolic flux analysis contribute to improved understanding of steady-state properties of metabolism. However, knowledge about kinetics and enzyme activities though essential for quantitative understanding of metabolic dynamics remains scarce and involves uncertainty. Here, we present a computational methodology that allow us to determine and quantify the kinetic parameters that correspond to a certain physiology as it is described by a given metabolic flux profile and a given metabolite concentration vector. Though we initially determine kinetic parameters that involve a high degree of uncertainty, through the use of kinetic modeling and machine learning principles we are able to obtain more accurate ranges of kinetic parameters, and hence we are able to reduce the uncertainty in the model analysis. We computed the distribution of kinetic parameters for glucose-fed E. coli producing 1,4-butanediol and we discovered that the observed physiological state corresponds to a narrow range of kinetic parameters of only a few enzymes, whereas the kinetic parameters of other enzymes can vary widely. Furthermore, this analysis suggests which are the enzymes that should be manipulated in order to engineer the reference state of the cell in a desired way. The proposed approach also sets up the foundations of a novel type of approaches for efficient, non-asymptotic, uniform sampling of solution spaces.},

In this paper, the first of two, the sparsely covered membrane (SCM) case is presented. This considers the limiting situation where platelet membrane binding sites are in excess, such that no membrane saturation or binding competition occurs. Under these conditions, the model predicts that the two positive feedback loops lead to multiple steady-state behavior in the range of intermediate mass transfer rates. It will be shown that this results in three parameter regions exhibiting very different thrombin production patterns. The model predicts the effect of flow on steady-state and dynamic thrombin production and attempts to explain the difference between venous and arterial thrombi. The reliance of thrombin production on precursor procoagulant protein concentrations is also assessed.},

	Abstract = {We have developed a model of the extrinsic blood coagulation system that includes the stoichiometric anticoagulants. The model accounts for the formation, expression, and propagation of the vitamin K-dependent procoagulant complexes and extends our previous model by including: (a) the tissue factor pathway inhibitor (TFPI)-mediated inactivation of tissue factor (TF).VIIa and its product complexes; (b) the antithrombin-III (AT-III)-mediated inactivation of IIa, mIIa, factor VIIa, factor IXa, and factor Xa; (c) the initial activation of factor V and factor VIII by thrombin generated by factor Xa-membrane; (d) factor VIIIa dissociation/activity loss; (e) the binding competition and kinetic activation steps that exist between TF and factors VII and VIIa; and (f) the activation of factor VII by IIa, factor Xa, and factor IXa. These additions to our earlier model generate a model consisting of 34 differential equations with 42 rate constants that together describe the 27 independent equilibrium expressions, which describe the fates of 34 species. Simulations are initiated by "exposing" picomolar concentrations of TF to an electronic milieu consisting of factors II, IX, X, VII, VIIa, V, and VIIII, and the anticoagulants TFPI and AT-III at concentrations found in normal plasma or associated with coagulation pathology. The reaction followed in terms of thrombin generation, proceeds through phases that can be operationally defined as initiation, propagation, and termination. The generation of thrombin displays a nonlinear dependence upon TF, AT-III, and TFPI and the combination of these latter inhibitors displays kinetic thresholds. At subthreshold TF, thrombin production/expression is suppressed by the combination of TFPI and AT-III; for concentrations above the TF threshold, the bolus of thrombin produced is quantitatively equivalent. A comparison of the model with empirical laboratory data illustrates that most experimentally observable parameters are captured, and the pathology that results in enhanced or deficient thrombin generation is accurately described.},

Differential equations describing the fate of each species in the reaction were developed and solved using an interactive procedure based upon the Runge-Kutta technique. In addition to the theoretical considerations involving the reactions of the tissue factor pathway, a physical constraint associated with the stability of the factor VIIIa-factor IXa complex has been incorporated into the model based upon the empirical observations associated with the stability of this complex. The model system provides a realistic accounting of the fates of each of the proteins in the coagulation reaction through a range of initiator (factor VIIa-tissue factor) concentrations ranging from 5 pM to 5 nM. The model is responsive to alterations in the concentrations of factor VIII, factor V, and their respective activated species, factor VIIIa and factor Va, and overall provides a reasonable approximation of empirical data. The computer model permits the assessment of the reaction over a broad range of conditions and provides a useful tool for the development and management of reaction studies.},

	Abstract = {Recombinant factor VIIa (rFVIIa) was developed to provide an improved procoagulant component capable of 'by-passing' inhibitor antibodies in the treatment of haemophilic patients. The primary objective of this study was to compare the efficacy of two dosage regimens of rFVIIa (given intravenously at periodic intervals) in the treatment of joint, muscle and mucocutaneous haemorrhages in persons with haemophilia A and B with and without inhibitors. The study was designed as a randomized, double-blind, parallel group, international multicenter trial. Patients were randomly allocated to treatment A: 35 mu kg-1 or B: 70 mu kg-1, in blocks of 2. Within each block, one patient was assigned to the 35 mu kg-1 dosing regimen and the other to 70 mu kg-1 dose. One hundred and fifty subjects from 20 sites were screened for this study and 116 had baseline assessments. Of these, 84 were treated on the protocol and 32 were not treated in the study, in most cases because they did not return to the clinic with an eligible bleeding episode. One hundred and seventy-nine bleeding episodes were treated, of which 145 (81%) were acute haemarthroses. Both treatments were efficacious, with 71% having an excellent (59% and 60%) or effective (12% and 11%) response. Overall, the mean and median number of doses given per episode of joint bleeding were 3.1 and 2, respectively. The mean number of doses was 3.1 for the 70 mu kg-1 group and 2.7 for the 35 mu kg-1 group (P value = 0.142). The study concluded that rFVIIa in a dosage of 35 mu kg-1 or 70 mu kg-1 is both safe and reasonably effective in the treatment of joint or muscle haemorrhages in haemophilic patients with inhibitor antibodies to factor VIII or factor IX. It is concluded that the appropriate dose for the treatment of joint and peripheral muscle bleeding in haemophilic patients with inhibitors is 35-70 mu kg-1 given at 2-3 h intervals until haemostasis is achieved.},

	Abstract = {In the last decade numerous mathematical models have been formulated to investigate specific components of the clotting system such as the tissue factor pathway of coagulation. Sophisticated, multiscale models were developed to better understand the interplay of flow-mediated transport, platelet deposition, and coagulation kinetics, and their overall effect on thrombus formation. Promotion of thrombus growth is partially due to the well-known pro-coagulant roles of platelets like the surface-dependent coagulation reactions. Iterations of theoretical model predictions and experiment have helped to elucidate anticoagulant roles of platelets as well. These roles include paving over the subendothelium and hindering transport of substrates to and from enzyme complexes which can strongly affect thrombus formation. In this review, we give a brief overview of theoretical models of thrombus formation under flow and some of the experiments that motivated them and were motivated by them.},

	Abstract = {A previously validated mathematical model of intravascular platelet deposition and tissue factor (TF)-initiated coagulation under flow is extended and used to assess the influence on thrombin production of the activation of factor XI (fXI) by thrombin and of the activation of factor IX (fIX) by fXIa. It is found that the importance of the thrombin-fXIa-fIXa feedback loop to robust thrombin production depends on the concentration of platelets in the blood near the injury. At a near-wall platelet concentration of ~250,000/μL, typical in vessels in which the shear rate is <200 s(-1), thrombin activation of fXI makes a significant difference only at low densities of exposed TF. If the near-wall platelet concentration is significantly higher than this, either because of a higher systemic platelet count or because of the redistribution of platelets toward the vessel walls at high shear rates, then thrombin activation of fXI makes a major difference even for relatively high densities of exposed TF. The model predicts that the effect of a severe fXI deficiency depends on the platelet count, and that fXI becomes more important at high platelet counts.},

	Abstract = {The process of tissue factor initiated blood coagulation is discussed. Reactions of the blood coagulation cascade are propagated by complex enzymes containing a vitamin K-dependent serine protease and an accessory cofactor protein that are assembled on a membrane surface in a calcium-dependent manner. These complexes are 105-109-fold more efficient in proteolyses of their natural substrates than enzymes alone. Based upon data acquired using several in vitro models of blood coagulation, tissue factor initiated thrombin generation can be divided into two phases: an initiation phase and a propagation phase. The initiation phase is characterized by the generation of nanomolar amounts of thrombin, femto- to picomolar amounts of factors VIIa, IXa, Xa, and XIa, partial activation of platelets, and almost quantitative activation of procofactors, factors V and VIII. The duration of this phase is primarily influenced by concentrations of tissue factor and TFPI. The characteristic features of the propagation phase are: almost quantitative prothrombin activation at a high rate, completion of platelet activation, and solid clot formation. This phase is primarily regulated by antithrombin III and the protein C system. Thrombin generation during the propagation phase is remarkably suppressed in the absence of factor VIII and IX (hemophilia A and B, respectively) and at platelet counts <5% of mean plasma concentration. The majority of data accumulated in in vitro models and discussed in this review are in good agreement with the results of in vivo observations.},

	Abstract = {Perioperative bleeding is a major challenge particularly because of increasing clinical use of potent antithrombotic drugs. Understanding current concepts of coagulation is important in determining the preoperative bleeding risk of patients, and in managing hemostatic therapy perioperatively. The serine protease thrombin plays pivotal roles in the activation of additional serine protease zymogens (inactive enzymatic precursors), cofactors, and cell-surface receptors. Thrombin generation is closely regulated to locally achieve rapid hemostasis after injury without causing uncontrolled systemic thrombosis. During surgery, there are major disturbances in coagulation and inflammatory systems because of hemorrhage/hemodilution, blood transfusion, and surgical stresses. Postoperative bleeding often requires allogeneic blood transfusions, which support thrombin generation and hemostasis. However, procoagulant activity and inflammation are increased postoperatively; thus, antithrombotic therapy may be required to prevent perioperative thrombotic complications. There have been significant advances in the management of perioperative hemostasis and thrombosis because of the introduction of novel hemostatic and antithrombotic drugs. However, a limitation of current treatment is that conventional clotting tests do not reflect the entire physiological processes of coagulation making optimal pharmacologic therapy difficult. Understanding the in vivo regulatory mechanisms and pharmacologic modulation of thrombin generation may help control bleeding without potentially increasing prothrombotic risks. In this review, we focus on the regulatory mechanisms of hemostasis and thrombin generation using multiple, simplified models of coagulation.},

	Abstract = {BACKGROUND: Cells process signals using complex and dynamic networks. Studying how this is performed in a context and cell type specific way is essential to understand signaling both in physiological and diseased situations. Context-specific medium/high throughput proteomic data measured upon perturbation is now relatively easy to obtain but formalisms that can take advantage of these features to build models of signaling are still comparatively scarce.
RESULTS: Here we present CellNOptR, an open-source R software package for building predictive logic models of signaling networks by training networks derived from prior knowledge to signaling (typically phosphoproteomic) data. CellNOptR features different logic formalisms, from Boolean models to differential equations, in a common framework. These different logic model representations accommodate state and time values with increasing levels of detail. We provide in addition an interface via Cytoscape (CytoCopteR) to facilitate use and integration with Cytoscape network-based capabilities.
CONCLUSIONS: Models generated with this pipeline have two key features. First, they are constrained by prior knowledge about the network but trained to data. They are therefore context and cell line specific, which results in enhanced predictive and mechanistic insights. Second, they can be built using different logic formalisms depending on the richness of the available data. Models built with CellNOptR are useful tools to understand how signals are processed by cells and how this is altered in disease. They can be used to predict the effect of perturbations (individual or in combinations), and potentially to engineer therapies that have differential effects/side effects depending on the cell type or context.},

These interaction graphs provide valuable insight into the topologies of complex biological networks but are rarely context specific and cannot be used to predict the responses of cell signaling proteins to specific ligands or drugs. Conversely, traditional approaches to analyzing cell signaling are narrow in scope and cannot easily make use of network-level data. Here, we combine network analysis and functional experimentation by using a hybrid approach in which graphs are converted into simple mathematical models that can be trained against biochemical data. Specifically, we created Boolean logic models of immediate-early signaling in liver cells by training a literature-based prior knowledge network against biochemical data obtained from primary human hepatocytes and 4 hepatocellular carcinoma cell lines exposed to combinations of cytokines and small-molecule kinase inhibitors. Distinct families of models were recovered for each cell type, and these families clustered topologically into normal and diseased sets.},

The timing of administration, dosage, mortality, units of blood transfusion saved, risk of thrombotic events, and risk/benefits ratio are presently poorly defined. A Medline search from 1995 through March 2008 was conducted. All English language articles containing the terms "trauma" and "factor VII" or its variants were retrieved. Letters to the editor, animal studies, and general reviews were excluded. A total of 19 articles met inclusion criteria. These articles were then reviewed and stratified into three classes of evidence according to the quality assessment instrument developed by the Brain and Trauma Foundation. Levels of recommendation were developed. A total of 118 articles were identified. Only one Class I study was identified. This study demonstrated that three doses of rFVIIa given in blunt traumatic hemorrhage yielded a significant reduction of 2.6 of red blood cells used. These findings were not statistically significant for penetrating trauma patients. There was no reduction in mortality and no increase in thromboembolic events. Four Class II studies were identified; three showed a significant decrease of blood product usage and one demonstrated significant reductions in 24-hour and 30 day death from hemorrhage in patients receiving rFVIIa. The remaining 14 studies were Class III reviews of databases, registries, case series, and case reports. No identified study specifically addressed the cost/benefit analysis of rFVIIa usage in trauma hemorrhage. Utility of rFVIIa in trauma-associated hemorrhage remains controversial. There is Level I supporting the use of rFVIIa for blunt trauma patients only. There is no Class I evidence supporting decreased mortality or differences in thromboembolic events. Minimal effective dosing regimens and cost/benefit analyses have not yet been examined.},

@article{Cirit:2012kx,
	Abstract = {Signal transduction networks in mammalian cells, comprising a limited set of interacting biochemical pathways, are accessed by various growth factor and cytokine receptors to elicit distinct cell responses. This raises the question as to how specificity of the stimulus-response relationship is encoded at the molecular level. It has been proposed that specificity arises not only from the activation of unique signalling pathways, but also from quantitative differences in the activation and regulation of shared receptor-proximal signalling proteins. To address such hypotheses, data sets with greater precision and coverage of experimental conditions will need to be acquired, and rigorous frameworks that codify and parameterize the inherently non-linear relationships among signalling activities will need to be developed. In the present study we apply a systematic approach combining quantitative measurements and mathematical modelling to compare the signalling networks accessed by FGF (fibroblast growth factor) and PDGF (platelet-derived growth factor) receptors in mouse fibroblasts, in which the ERK (extracellular-signal-regulated kinase) cascade is activated by Ras- and PI3K (phosphoinositide 3-kinase)-dependent pathways. We show that, whereas the FGF stimulation of PI3K signalling is relatively weak, this deficiency is compensated for by a more potent Ras-dependent activation of ERK. Thus, as the modelling would predict, the ERK pathway is activated to a greater extent in cells co-stimulated with FGF and PDGF, relative to the saturated levels achieved with either ligand alone. It is envisaged that similar approaches will prove valuable in the elucidation of quantitative differences among other closely related receptor signalling networks.},

	Abstract = {In terms of its soluble precursors, the coagulation proteome varies quantitatively among apparently healthy individuals. The significance of this variability remains obscure, in part because it is the backdrop against which the hemostatic consequences of more dramatic composition differences are studied. In this study we have defined the consequences of normal range variation of components of the coagulation proteome by using a mechanism-based computational approach that translates coagulation factor concentration data into a representation of an individual's thrombin generation potential. A novel graphical method is used to integrate standard measures that characterize thrombin generation in both empirical and computational models (e.g max rate, max level, total thrombin, time to 2 nM thrombin ("clot time")) to visualize how normal range variation in coagulation factors results in unique thrombin generation phenotypes. Unique ensembles of the 8 coagulation factors encompassing the limits of normal range variation were used as initial conditions for the computational modeling, each ensemble representing "an individual" in a theoretical healthy population. These "individuals" with unremarkable proteome composition was then compared to actual normal and "abnormal" individuals, i.e. factor ensembles measured in apparently healthy individuals, actual coagulopathic individuals or artificially constructed factor ensembles representing individuals with specific factor deficiencies. A sensitivity analysis was performed to rank either individual factors or all possible pairs of factors in terms of their contribution to the overall distribution of thrombin generation phenotypes. Key findings of these analyses include: normal range variation of coagulation factors yields thrombin generation phenotypes indistinguishable from individuals with some, but not all, coagulopathies examined; coordinate variation of certain pairs of factors within their normal ranges disproportionately results in extreme thrombin generation phenotypes, implying that measurement of a smaller set of factors may be sufficient to identify individuals with aberrant thrombin generation potential despite normal coagulation proteome composition.},

	Abstract = {This paper describes microfluidic experiments with human blood plasma and numerical simulations to determine the role of fluid flow in the regulation of propagation of blood clotting. We demonstrate that propagation of clotting can be regulated by different mechanisms depending on the volume-to-surface ratio of a channel. In small channels, propagation of clotting can be prevented by surface-bound inhibitors of clotting present on vessel walls. In large channels, where surface-bound inhibitors are ineffective, propagation of clotting can be prevented by a shear rate above a threshold value, in agreement with predictions of a simple reaction-diffusion mechanism. We also demonstrate that propagation of clotting in a channel with a large volume-to-surface ratio and a shear rate below a threshold shear rate can be slowed by decreasing the production of thrombin, an activator of clotting. These in vitro results make two predictions, which should be experimentally tested in vivo. First, propagation of clotting from superficial veins to deep veins may be regulated by shear rate, which might explain the correlation between superficial thrombosis and the development of deep vein thrombosis (DVT). Second, nontoxic thrombin inhibitors with high binding affinities could be locally administered to prevent recurrent thrombosis after a clot has been removed. In addition, these results demonstrate the utility of simplified mechanisms and microfluidics for generating and testing predictions about the dynamics of complex biochemical networks.},

For proof of concept, we develop a library of mechanistically alternative dynamic models for the highly conserved target-of-rapamycin (TOR) pathway of Saccharomyces cerevisiae. In contrast to the prevailing view of a de novo assembly of type 2A phosphatases (PP2As), our integrated computational and experimental analysis proposes a specificity factor, based on Tap42p-Tip41p, for PP2As as the key signaling mechanism that is quantitatively consistent with all available experimental data. Beyond revising our picture of TOR signaling, we expect ensemble modeling to help elucidate other insufficiently characterized cellular circuits.},

A wide individual variation regarding recovery of rFVIIa (46 +/- 12%; median 43%) as well as of clearance rate (36 +/- 8 ml/kg/h; median 32 ml/kg/h in adults; children 2-3 times higher) has been observed. Thus children may require higher doses than adults. Accordingly the use of a dose of 270 microg/kg in one single injection was approved in the EU. Recent experience indicates that repeated doses of rFVIIa may decrease the number of bleeds in "target joints", and thus may be useful as prophylaxis in severe hemophilia with inhibitors. Pharmacological concentrations of rFVIIa have been shown to enhance the thrombin generation on thrombin activated platelets in a cell-based model. By doing so a tight structured fibrin haemostatic plug resistant against premature lysis is formed. rFVIIa has been shown to induce haemostasis not only in haemophilia but also in other situations characterized by an impaired thrombin generation such as platelet defects, dilution coagulopathy developed as a result of trauma and extensive surgery. A special form of profuse bleeding, that may cause extensive problems is postpartum haemorrhage.},

	Abstract = {Achieving hemostasis following vascular injury requires the rapid accumulation of platelets and fibrin. Here we used a combination of confocal intravital imaging, genetically engineered mice, and antiplatelet agents to determine how variations in the extent of platelet activation following vascular injury arise from the integration of different elements of the platelet-signaling network. Two forms of penetrating injury were used to evoke the hemostatic response. Both produced a hierarchically organized structure in which a core of fully activated platelets was overlaid with an unstable shell of less-activated platelets. This structure emerged as hemostasis was achieved and persisted for at least 60 minutes following injury, its organization at least partly reflecting agonist concentration gradients. Thrombin activity and fibrin formation were found primarily in the innermost core. As proposed previously, greater packing density in the core facilitated contact-dependent signaling and limited entry of plasma-borne molecules visualized with fluorophores coupled to dextran and albumin. Blocking contact-dependent signaling or inhibiting thrombin reduced the size of the core, while the shell was heavily influenced by adenosine 5'-diphosphate and regulators of Gi2-mediated signaling. Thus, the hemostatic response is shown to produce a hierarchical structure arising, in part, from distinct elements of the platelet-signaling network.},

The model gives reasonable predictions of published experimental results without the adjustment of any parameter values. The model also accounts explicitly for the effects of serine protease inhibitors on thrombin generation. Simulations to define the optimum affinity profile of an inhibitor in this system indicate that for an inhibitor simultaneously potent against VIIa, IXa, and Xa, inhibition of thrombin generation decreases dramatically as the affinity for thrombin increases. Additional simulations show that the reason for this behavior is the sequestration of the inhibitor by small amounts of thrombin generated early in the reaction. This model is also useful for predicting the potency of compounds that inhibit thrombosis in rats. We believe that this is the first mathematical model of blood coagulation that considers the effects of exogenous inhibitors. Such a model, or extensions thereof, should be useful for evaluating targets for therapeutic intervention in the processes of blood coagulation.},

	Abstract = {The ability of factor VIIa to initiate thrombin generation and clot formation in blood from healthy donors, blood from patients with hemophilia A, and in anti-factor IX antibody-induced ("acquired") hemophilia B blood was investigated. In normal blood, both factor VIIa-tissue factor (TF) complex and factor VIIa alone initiated thrombin generation. The efficiency of factor VIIa was about 0.0001 that of the factor VIIa-TF complex. In congenital hemophilia A blood and "acquired" hemophilia B blood in vitro, addition of 10 to 50 nM factor VIIa (pharmacologic concentrations) corrected the clotting time at all TF concentrations tested (0-100 pM) but had little effect on thrombin generation. Fibrinopeptide release and insoluble clot formation were only marginally influenced by addition of factor VIIa. TF alone had a more pronounced effect on thrombin generation; an increase in TF from 0 to 100 pM increased the maximum thrombin level in "acquired" hemophilia B blood from 120 to 480 nM. Platelet activation was considerably enhanced by addition of factor VIIa to both hemophilia A blood and "acquired" hemophilia B blood. Thus, pharmacologic concentrations of factor VIIa cannot restore normal thrombin generation in hemophilia A and hemophilia B blood in vitro. The efficacy of factor VIIa (10-50 nM) in hemophilia blood is dependent on TF.},

	Abstract = {Fibrinolysis is the enzymatic degradation of the fibrin mesh that stabilizes blood clots. Experiments have shown that coarse clots made of thick fibres sometimes lyse more quickly than fine clots made of thin fibres, despite the fact that individual thick fibres lyse more slowly than individual thin fibres. This paper aims at using a 1D continuum reaction-diffusion model of fibrinolysis to elucidate the mechanism by which coarse clots lyse more quickly than fine clots. Reaction-diffusion models have been the standard tool for investigating fibrinolysis, and have been successful in capturing the wave-like behaviour of lysis seen in experiments. These previous models treat the distribution of fibrin within a clot as homogeneous, and therefore cannot be used directly to study the lysis of fine and coarse clots. In our model, we include a spatially heterogeneous fibrin concentration, as well as a more accurate description of the role of fibrin as a cofactor in the activation of the lytic enzyme. Our model predicts spatio-temporal protein distributions in reasonable quantitative agreement with experimental data. The model also predicts observed behaviour such as a front of lysis moving through the clot with an accumulation of lytic proteins at the front. In spite of the model improvements, however, we find that 1D continuum models are unable to accurately describe the observed differences in lysis behaviour between fine and coarse clots. Features of the problems that lead to the inaccuracy of 1D continuum models are discussed. We conclude that higher-dimensional, multiscale models are required to investigate the effect of clot structure on lysis behaviour.},

	Abstract = {Fibrinolysis, the proteolytic degradation of the fibrin fibres that stabilize blood clots, is initiated when tissue-type plasminogen activator (tPA) activates plasminogen to plasmin, the main fibrinolytic enzyme. Many experiments have shown that coarse clots made of thick fibres lyse more quickly than fine clots made of thin fibres, despite the fact that individual thick fibres lyse more slowly than individual thin fibres. The generally accepted explanation for this is that a coarse clot with fewer fibres to transect will be degraded faster than a fine clot with a higher fibre density. Other experiments show the opposite result. The standard mathematical tool for investigating fibrinolysis has been deterministic reaction-diffusion models, but due to low tPA concentrations, stochastic models may be more appropriate. We develop a 3D stochastic multiscale model of fibrinolysis. A microscale model representing a fibre cross section and containing detailed biochemical reactions provides information about single fibre lysis times, the number of plasmin molecules that can be activated by a single tPA molecule and the length of time tPA stays bound to a given fibre cross section. Data from the microscale model are used in a macroscale model of the full fibrin clot, from which we obtain lysis front velocities and tPA distributions. We find that the fibre number impacts lysis speed, but so does the number of tPA molecules relative to the surface area of the clot exposed to those molecules. Depending on the values of these two quantities (tPA number and surface area), for given kinetic parameters, the model predicts coarse clots lyse faster or slower than fine clots, thus providing a possible explanation for the divergent experimental observations.},

	Abstract = {This article demonstrates that a simple chemical model system, built by using a modular approach, may be used to predict the spatiotemporal dynamics of initiation of blood clotting in the complex network of hemostasis. Microfluidics was used to create in vitro environments that expose both the complex network and the model system to surfaces patterned with patches presenting clotting stimuli. Both systems displayed a threshold response, with clotting initiating only on isolated patches larger than a threshold size. The magnitude of the threshold patch size for both systems was described by the Damk{\"o}hler number, measuring competition of reaction and diffusion. Reaction produces activators at the patch, and diffusion removes activators from the patch. The chemical model made additional predictions that were validated experimentally with human blood plasma. These experiments show that blood can be exposed to significant amounts of clot-inducing stimuli, such as tissue factor, without initiating clotting. Overall, these results demonstrate that such chemical model systems, implemented with microfluidics, may be used to predict spatiotemporal dynamics of complex biochemical networks.},

The reaction systems were constructed in vitro using purified, natural, and recombinant proteins and synthetic phospholipid vesicles or platelets with the reactions initiated by recombinant tissue factor (TF)-factor VIIa complex (5 pmol/L). To investigate the influence of the protein C system, soluble thrombomodulin (Tm) was also added to the reaction mixture. For the most extreme situations in which the essential plasma procoagulants (prothrombin, and factors X, IX, V, and VIII) and the stoichiometric anticoagulants (AT-III and TFPI) were collectively and inversely altered by 50%, a 28-fold difference in the total available thrombin generated was observed. Variations of most of these proteins 50% above and below the "normal" range, with the remainder at 100%, had only modest influences on the peak and total levels of thrombin generated. The dominant factors influencing thrombin generation were prothrombin and AT-III. When these 2 components were held at 100% and all other plasma procoagulants were reduced to 50%, there was a 60% reduction in the available thrombin generated. No increase in the thrombin generated was observed when the 150% level of all plasma procoagulants other than prothrombin was evaluated. When only prothrombin was raised to 150%, and all other factors were maintained at 100%, the thrombin generated increased by 71% to 121%. When AT-III was at 50% and all other constituents were at 100%, thrombin production was increased by 104% to 196%. The additions of protein C and protein S over the 50% to 150% ranges with Tm at 0.1 nmol/L concentration had limited influence on thrombin generation. Individual variations in factors VII, XI, and X concentrations had little effect on the duration of the initiation phase, the peak thrombin level achieved, or the available thrombin generated. Paradoxically, increases in factor IX concentration to 150% led to lowered thrombin generation, while decreases to 50% led to enhanced thrombin generation, most likely a consequence of factor IX as a competitive substrate with factor X for factor VIIa-TF. Reductions in factor V or factor VIII concentration led to prolongations of the initiation phase, while the reduction of TFPI to 50% led to shortening of this phase. However, none of these alterations led to significant changes in the available thrombin generated. Based on these data, one might surmise that increases in prothrombin and reductions in AT-III, within the normal range, would be potential risk factors for thrombosis and that algorithms that combine normal factor levels may be required to develop predictive tests for thrombosis.},

	Abstract = {Inorganic polyphosphate is an abundant component of acidocalcisomes of bacteria and unicellular eukaryotes. Human platelet dense granules strongly resemble acidocalcisomes, and we recently showed that they contain substantial amounts of polyphosphate, which is secreted upon platelet activation. We now report that polyphosphate is a potent hemostatic regulator, accelerating blood clotting by activating the contact pathway and promoting the activation of factor V, which in turn results in abrogation of the function of the natural anticoagulant protein, tissue factor pathway inhibitor. Polyphosphate was also found to delay clot lysis by enhancing a natural antifibrinolytic agent, thrombin-activatable fibrinolysis inhibitor. Polyphosphate is unstable in blood or plasma, owing to the presence of phosphatases. We propose that polyphosphate released from platelets or microorganisms initially promotes clot formation and stability; subsequent degradation of polyphosphate by blood phosphatases fosters inhibition of clotting and activation of fibrinolysis during wound healing.},

This prospective, double-blind study compared rFVIIa (35 vs. 90 microg/kg) in the initiation and maintenance of haemostasis during and after elective surgery. Patients with inhibitors (FVIII, n = 26; FIX, n = 3) received rFVIIa immediately prior to incision; intraoperatively as needed; every 2 h for the first 48 h; and every 2-6 h for the following 3 days. Haemostasis was evaluated during surgery, at 0, 8, 24 and 48 h and 3, 4 and 5 days after wound closure. After day 5, open-label rFVIIa (90 microg/kg) was available for maintenance. Intraoperative haemostasis was achieved in 28/29 patients. All high-dose patients and 12/15 low dose patients had satisfactory haemostasis during the first 48 h. Twenty-three patients (13/14 high dose) successfully completed the study. Although the 35 microg/kg dose is probably sub-optimal for post-operative management, at least in major procedures, rFVIIa 90 microg/kg is an effective first-line option in surgery for patients with inhibitors.},

	Abstract = {Mathematical models have substantially improved our ability to predict the response of a complex biological system to perturbation, but their use is typically limited by difficulties in specifying model topology and parameter values. Additionally, incorporating entities across different biological scales ranging from molecular to organismal in the same model is not trivial. Here, we present a framework called "querying quantitative logic models" (Q2LM) for building and asking questions of constrained fuzzy logic (cFL) models. cFL is a recently developed modeling formalism that uses logic gates to describe influences among entities, with transfer functions to describe quantitative dependencies. Q2LM does not rely on dedicated data to train the parameters of the transfer functions, and it permits straight-forward incorporation of entities at multiple biological scales. The Q2LM framework can be employed to ask questions such as: Which therapeutic perturbations accomplish a designated goal, and under what environmental conditions will these perturbations be effective? We demonstrate the utility of this framework for generating testable hypotheses in two examples: (i) a intracellular signaling network model; and (ii) a model for pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of cell-cytokine interactions; in the latter, we validate hypotheses concerning molecular design of granulocyte colony stimulating factor.},

	Abstract = {Information contained in this review of the use of recombinant factor VIIa (rFVIIa, NovoSeven) in the pediatric population was obtained through review of literature and abstraction of data available at Novo Nordisk. Pharmacokinetic investigations in hemophilic children suggest that rFVIIa may have a shorter half-life and more rapid clearance in the pediatric population than in adults, with resultant implications for dosing. Analysis of pediatric data from various studies and case reports indicates that rFVIIa is safe and effective for the control of spontaneous or surgical bleeding in hemophilic children with inhibitors, including central nervous system bleeds, and bleeding episodes during immune tolerance induction therapy. The very young pediatric population (less than 1 year of age) poses specific difficulties in treatment, and rFVIIa provides an effective alternative to other therapeutic modalities. In some hemophilia B patients with inhibitors, anaphylactic reaction to FIX infusions is a potentially life-threatening problem, for which rFVIIa may provide the only safe alternative therapy for the control of bleeding episodes. Continuous infusion of rFVIIa has also been used effectively in individual cases. Optimal dosing regimens, both intermittent and continuous, still need to be determined in children.},

@article{Adams:2009aa,
	Abstract = {Coagulation involves the regulated sequence of proteolytic activation of a series of zymogens to achieve appropriate and timely haemostasis in an injured vessel, in an environment that overwhelmingly favours an anticoagulant state. In the non-pathological state, the inciting event involves exposure of circulating factor VII/VIIa to extravascularly expressed tissue factor, which brings into motion the series of steps which results in amplification of the initial stimulus, culminating in the conversion of fibrinogen to fibrin and clot formation. The precisely synchronized cascade of events is counter-balanced by a system of anticoagulant mechanisms, which serve to ensure that the haemostatic effect is regulated and does not extend inappropriately. Conversely, in pathological states, these events can escape normal control mechanisms, due to either inherited or acquired defects, which lead to thrombosis. Current anticoagulant therapy, although based on medications that have been in existence for upwards of 80 years, is moving towards targeted therapy for specific coagulation factors and events in the coagulation cascade, based on the current knowledge of the main triggers and key events within the series of reactions that culminates in haemostasis. It remains to be seen whether these newer medications will become first-line therapies for thrombosis in the coming decade. This review aims to elucidate the main events within the coagulation cascade as it is currently understood to operate in vivo, with a brief discussion focusing on hypercoagulable states, and also a short review of the history of anticoagulants as they relate to this model.},

	Abstract = {A simulation model for the production of thrombin in plasma is presented. Values of the reaction rate constants as determined in purified systems are used and the model is tested by comparison of simulations of factor Xa, factor Va and thrombin generation curves with experimental data obtained in thromboplastin-activated plasma. Simulations of the effect of hirudin indicate that factor V is predominantly activated by thrombin and not by factor Xa. The model predicts a threshold value for the factor Xa production which, if exceeded, results in explosive and complete activation of prothrombinase. The dependence of this threshold value on different negative feedback reactions, e.g. the inactivation of thrombin and factor Xa by antithrombin III (+ heparin), is investigated. The threshold value, for control plasma in the range of 1-10 pM total factor Xa production, can be raised two orders of magnitude by accelerated inactivation of factor Xa and prothrombinase but is hardly affected by a tenfold increase in the rate of thrombin inactivation or by increased production of activated protein C. This latter effect, however, results in a more gradual input-response relation between factor Xa input and the extent of prothrombinase activation.},

For an input average lumen blood velocity of 0.478 cm/s (measured by Doppler velocimetry), a 0.2 mm/s mean flow rate was obtained within the thrombus structure, most of which occurred in the 100-fold more permeable outer shell region (calculated permeability of the inner core was 10(-11) cm(2)). Average wall shear stresses were 80-100 dyne/cm(2) (peak values >200 dyne/cm(2)) on the outer rough surface of the thrombus. Within the thrombus, small molecule tracers (0.1 kDa) experienced ~70,000 collisions/s and penetrated/exited it in about 1 s, whereas proteins (~50 kDa) had ~9000 collisions/s and required about 10 s (tortuosity ~2-2.5).

	Abstract = {Increasing evidence suggests that a single dose of 270 microg/kg recombinant activated factor VII (rFVIIa) may be a convenient, safe, and effective alternative to the repeat-dose regimen for hemophilia patients with inhibitors. Three recent trials investigating on-demand treatment (Kavakli et al 2006, Santagostino et al 2006, and Young et al 2008) lend further weight to earlier reports demonstrating that a single dose of 270 microg/kg rFVIIa is as effective as a repeat-dose schedule of 3 x 90 microg/kg rFVIIa in producing hemostasis, reducing the need for additional hemostatic medications, and improving pain and mobility in joints affected by hemarthroses. The single-dose regimen is advantageous as it may reduce both the difficulties caused by the need for repeated venous access and the interruption of daily activities associated with repeat dosing. Safety data from these three trials, along with those from a fourth study investigating the prophylactic use of 270 microg/kg rFVIIa, also demonstrate no additional or altered safety profile associated with single-dose treatment. These findings suggest that a single dose of 270 microg/kg rFVIIa is as safe and effective a hemostatic regimen as the standard lower, more frequent dose regimen and provides comparable bleeding control in hemophilia patients with inhibitors. The single-dose 270 microg/kg rFVIIa regimen utilized similar product consumption to the 3 x 90 microg/kg rFVIIa treatment regimen.},

	Abstract = {The canonical nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB) signaling pathway controls a gene network important in the cellular inflammatory response. Upon activation, NF-κB/RelA is released from cytoplasmic inhibitors, from where it translocates into the nucleus, subsequently activating negative feedback loops producing either monophasic or damped oscillatory nucleo-cytoplasmic dynamics. Although the population behavior of the NF-κB pathway has been extensively modeled, the sources of cell-to-cell variability are not well understood. We describe an integrated experimental-computational analysis of NF-κB/RelA translocation in a validated cell model exhibiting monophasic dynamics. Quantitative measures of cellular geometry and total cytoplasmic concentration and translocated RelA amounts were used as priors in Bayesian inference to estimate biophysically realistic parameter values based on dynamic live cell imaging studies of enhanced GFP-tagged RelA in stable transfectants. Bayesian inference was performed on multiple cells simultaneously, assuming identical reaction rate parameters, whereas cellular geometry and initial and total NF-κB concentration-related parameters were cell-specific. A subpopulation of cells exhibiting distinct kinetic profiles was identified that corresponded to differences in the IκBα translation rate. We conclude that cellular geometry, initial and total NF-κB concentration, IκBα translation, and IκBα degradation rates account for distinct cell-to-cell differences in canonical NF-κB translocation dynamics.},

	Abstract = {A kinetic Monte Carlo simulation was developed using the deterministic reaction network developed by the Mann laboratory for tissue-factor (TF)-initiated blood coagulation. The model predicted thrombin dynamics in recalcified whole blood (3-fold diluted) pretreated with convulxin (platelet GPVI activator) and picomolar levels of TF (0-14 pM). The model did not accurately predict coagulation times at low TF (0-0.7 pM). The simulation revealed that approximately 0.2 pM TF was the critical concentration to cause 50% of reactions containing 3-fold diluted whole blood to reach a clotting threshold of 0.05 U/ml thrombin by 1 h. Simulations of 1 nl of blood (5 pM TF) revealed small stochastic variations in thrombin initiation time, while 16.6 pl simulations were highly stochastic at this level of TF (50 molecules/16.6 pl). Further experiment and simulation will require evaluation of mechanisms of coagulation kinetics at subpicomolar levels of TF.},

	Abstract = {A mathematical model of the extrinsic or tissue factor (TF) pathway of blood coagulation is formulated and results from a computational study of its behavior are presented. The model takes into account plasma-phase and surface-bound enzymes and zymogens, coagulation inhibitors, and activated and unactivated platelets. It includes both plasma-phase and membrane-phase reactions, and accounts for chemical and cellular transport by flow and diffusion, albeit in a simplified manner by assuming the existence of a thin, well-mixed fluid layer, near the surface, whose thickness depends on flow. There are three main conclusions from these studies. (i) The model system responds in a threshold manner to changes in the availability of particular surface binding sites; an increase in TF binding sites, as would occur with vascular injury, changes the system's production of thrombin dramatically. (ii) The model suggests that platelets adhering to and covering the subendothelium, rather than chemical inhibitors, may play the dominant role in blocking the activity of the TF:VIIa enzyme complex. This, in turn, suggests that a role of the IXa-tenase pathway for activating factor X to Xa is to continue factor Xa production after platelets have covered the TF:VIIa complexes on the subendothelium. (iii) The model gives a kinetic explanation of the reduced thrombin production in hemophilias A and B.},

	Abstract = {Blood function defines bleeding and clotting risks and dictates approaches for clinical intervention. Independent of adding exogenous tissue factor (TF), human blood treated in vitro with corn trypsin inhibitor (CTI, to block Factor XIIa) will generate thrombin after an initiation time (T(i)) of 1 to 2 hours (depending on donor), while activation of platelets with the GPVI-activator convulxin reduces T(i) to ∼20 minutes. Since current kinetic models fail to generate thrombin in the absence of added TF, we implemented a Platelet-Plasma ODE model accounting for: the Hockin-Mann protease reaction network, thrombin-dependent display of platelet phosphatidylserine, VIIa function on activated platelets, XIIa and XIa generation and function, competitive thrombin substrates (fluorogenic detector and fibrinogen), and thrombin consumption during fibrin polymerization. The kinetic model consisting of 76 ordinary differential equations (76 species, 57 reactions, 105 kinetic parameters) predicted the clotting of resting and convulxin-activated human blood as well as predicted T(i) of human blood under 50 different initial conditions that titrated increasing levels of TF, Xa, Va, XIa, IXa, and VIIa. Experiments with combined anti-XI and anti-XII antibodies prevented thrombin production, demonstrating that a leak of XIIa past saturating amounts of CTI (and not "blood-borne TF" alone) was responsible for in vitro initiation without added TF. Clotting was not blocked by antibodies used individually against TF, VII/VIIa, P-selectin, GPIb, protein disulfide isomerase, cathepsin G, nor blocked by the ribosome inhibitor puromycin, the Clk1 kinase inhibitor Tg003, or inhibited VIIa (VIIai). This is the first model to predict the observed behavior of CTI-treated human blood, either resting or stimulated with platelet activators. CTI-treated human blood will clot in vitro due to the combined activity of XIIa and XIa, a process enhanced by platelet activators and which proceeds in the absence of any evidence for kinetically significant blood borne tissue factor.},

	Abstract = {PURPOSE OF REVIEW: The biochemistry of blood coagulation has been well defined over the past 50 years. Although much is known about the sequence of the proteolytic cascade and its regulation in the pathway to fibrin generation, many important questions remain unsolved about the mechanism of initiation and the structure of the protein complexes that form during blood coagulation.
RECENT FINDINGS: This article summarizes some of the advances that have been made in this field from the last quarter of 2002 and during 2003. The papers, which vary in rigor and content, have been selected on the basis of their interest and possible contribution to knowledge in this field. Summaries are given of new findings on the source of factor V and the synthesis of factor VIII, the mechanism of tissue factor action in the initiation of blood coagulation, the structure and membrane-binding properties of the protein complexes formed, and regulation of the blood coagulation cascade.
SUMMARY: Continued progress in this field offers opportunity for understanding the basis of thrombotic diseases and bleeding disorders, with the potential for defining novel targets for therapeutic applications. Some of the conclusions reviewed are conflicting, and further work will be necessary to place the results in the context of what has already been established. The structural biology of the coagulation proteins and understanding of hemostasis and thrombosis in a physiologic context have important implications for future work.},

	Abstract = {The presence of activation peptides (AP) of the vitamin K-dependent proteins in the phlebotomy blood of human subjects suggests that active serine proteases may circulate in blood as well. The goal of the current study was to evaluate the influence of trace amounts of key coagulation proteases on tissue factor-independent thrombin generation using three models of coagulation. With procoagulants and select coagulation inhibitors at mean physiological concentrations, concentrations of factor IXa, factor Xa, and thrombin were set either equal to those of their AP or to values that would result based upon the rates of AP/enzyme generation and steady state enzyme inhibition. In the latter case, numerical simulation predicts that sufficient thrombin to produce a solid clot would be generated in approximately 2 min. Empirical data from the synthetic plasma suggest clotting times of 3-5 min, which are similar to that observed in contact pathway-inhibited whole blood (4.3 min) initiated with the same concentrations of factors IXa and Xa and thrombin. Numerical simulations performed with the concentrations of two of the enzymes held constant and one varied suggest that the presence of any pair of enzymes is sufficient to yield rapid clot formation. Modeling of states (numerical simulation and whole blood) where only one circulating protease is present at steady state concentration shows significant thrombin generation only for factor IXa. The addition of factor Xa and thrombin has little effect (if any) on thrombin generation induced by factor IXa alone. These data indicate that 1) concentrations of active coagulation enzymes circulating in vivo are significantly lower than can be predicted from the concentrations of their AP, and 2) expected trace amounts of factor IXa can trigger thrombin generation in the absence of tissue factor.},

	Abstract = {Tissue factor-induced blood coagulation was studied in 20 individuals, for varying periods of time during 54 months, in contact pathway-inhibited whole blood at 37 degrees C and evaluated in terms of the activation of various substrates. After quenching over time with inhibitors, the soluble phases were analyzed for thrombin-antithrombin III (TAT) complex formation, prothrombin fragments, platelet activation (osteonectin release), factor Va generation, fibrinopeptide (FP) A and FPB release, and factor XIII activation. TAT complex formation, for 35 experiments, showed an initiation phase (up to 4.6 +/- 0.6 minutes) in which thrombin was generated at an average rate of 0.93 +/- 0.3 nM/min catalyzed by about 1.3 pM prothrombinase yielding approximately 26 nM thrombin. During a subsequent propagation phase, thrombin was generated at a rate of 83.9 +/- 3.8 nM/min by about 120 pM prothrombinase, reaching ultimate levels of 851 +/- 53 nM. Clot time, determined subjectively, occurred at 4.7 +/- 0.2 minutes and correlated with the inception of the propagation phase. The thrombin concentrations associated with the transitions to rapid product formation are 510 +/- 180 pM for platelet activation (1.9 +/- 0.2 minutes), 840 +/- 280 pM for factor XIII activation and factor Va generation (2.2 +/- 0.6 minutes), 1.3 +/- 0.4 nM for FPA release (2.5 +/- 0.7 minutes), 1.7 +/- 0.5 nM for FPB release and prethrombin 2 (2.8 +/- 0.8 minutes), 7.0 +/- 2.2 nM for thrombin B chain (3.6 +/- 0.2 minutes), and 26 +/- 6.2 nM for the propagation phase of TAT formation (4.6 +/- 0.6 minutes). These results illustrate that the initial activation of thrombin substrates occurs during the initiation phase at less than 2 nM thrombin (0.2%). Most thrombin (96%) is formed well after clotting occurs.},

	Abstract = {Predictive understanding of cell signaling network operation based on general prior knowledge but consistent with empirical data in a specific environmental context is a current challenge in computational biology. Recent work has demonstrated that Boolean logic can be used to create context-specific network models by training proteomic pathway maps to dedicated biochemical data; however, the Boolean formalism is restricted to characterizing protein species as either fully active or inactive. To advance beyond this limitation, we propose a novel form of fuzzy logic sufficiently flexible to model quantitative data but also sufficiently simple to efficiently construct models by training pathway maps on dedicated experimental measurements. Our new approach, termed constrained fuzzy logic (cFL), converts a prior knowledge network (obtained from literature or interactome databases) into a computable model that describes graded values of protein activation across multiple pathways. We train a cFL-converted network to experimental data describing hepatocytic protein activation by inflammatory cytokines and demonstrate the application of the resultant trained models for three important purposes: (a) generating experimentally testable biological hypotheses concerning pathway crosstalk, (b) establishing capability for quantitative prediction of protein activity, and (c) prediction and understanding of the cytokine release phenotypic response. Our methodology systematically and quantitatively trains a protein pathway map summarizing curated literature to context-specific biochemical data. This process generates a computable model yielding successful prediction of new test data and offering biological insight into complex datasets that are difficult to fully analyze by intuition alone.},

	Abstract = {There is a growing awareness that complement plays an integral role in human physiology and disease, transcending its traditional perception as an accessory system for pathogen clearance and opsonic cell killing. As the list of pathologies linked to dysregulated complement activation grows longer, it has become clear that targeted modulation of this innate immune system opens new windows of therapeutic opportunity for anti-inflammatory drug design. Indeed, the introduction of the first complement-targeting drugs has reignited a vibrant interest in the clinical translation of complement-based inhibitors. Compstatin was discovered as a cyclic peptide that inhibits complement activation by binding C3 and interfering with convertase formation and C3 cleavage. As the convergence point of all activation pathways and a molecular hub for crosstalk with multiple pathogenic pathways, C3 represents an attractive target for therapeutic modulation of the complement cascade. A multidisciplinary drug optimization effort encompassing rational 'wet' and in silico synthetic approaches and an array of biophysical, structural and analytical tools has culminated in an impressive structure-function refinement of compstatin, yielding a series of analogues that show promise for a wide spectrum of clinical applications. These new derivatives have improved inhibitory potency and pharmacokinetic profiles and show efficacy in clinically relevant primate models of disease. This review provides an up-to-date survey of the drug design effort placed on the compstatin family of C3 inhibitors, highlighting the most promising drug candidates. It also discusses translational challenges in complement drug discovery and peptide drug development and reviews concerns related to systemic C3 interception.},

	Abstract = {Ensemble modeling is a well established approach for obtaining robust predictions and for simulating course grained population behavior in deterministic mathematical models. In this study, we present a multiobjective based technique to estimate model ensembles, the Pareto Optimal Ensemble Technique in the Julia programming language (JuPOETs). JuPOETs integrates simulated annealing with Pareto optimality to estimate parameter ensembles on or near the optimal tradeoff surface between competing training objectives. We demonstrated JuPOETs on a suite of multiobjective problems, including test functions with parameter bounds and system constraints as well as for the identification of a proof-of-concept biochemical model with four conflicting training objectives. JuPOETs identified optimal or near optimal solutions approximately six-fold faster than a corresponding implementation in Octave for the suite of test functions. For the proof-of-concept biochemical model, JuPOETs produced an ensemble of parameters that gave both the mean of the training data for conflicting data sets, while simultaneously estimating parameter sets that performed well on each of the individual objective functions. JuPOETs can be adapted to solve many problem types, including mixed binary and continuous variable types, bilevel optimization problems and constrained problems without altering the base algorithm. JuPOETs can be installed using the Julia package manager from the JuPOETs GitHub repository at https://github.com/varnerlab/POETs.jl.},

@article{Nayak:2008aa,
	Abstract = {Robustness, a long-recognized property of living systems, allows function in the face of uncertainty while fragility, i.e., extreme sensitivity, can potentially lead to catastrophic failure following seemingly innocuous perturbations. Carlson and Doyle hypothesized that highly-evolved networks, e.g., those involved in cell-cycle regulation, can be resistant to some perturbations while highly sensitive to others. The "robust yet fragile" duality of networks has been termed Highly Optimized Tolerance (HOT) and has been the basis of new lines of inquiry in computational and experimental biology. In this study, we tested the working hypothesis that cell-cycle control architectures obey the HOT paradigm. Three cell-cycle models were analyzed using monte-carlo sensitivity analysis. Overall state sensitivity coefficients, which quantify the robustness or fragility of a given mechanism, were calculated using a monte-carlo strategy with three different numerical techniques along with multiple parameter perturbation strategies to control for possible numerical and sampling artifacts. Approximately 65% of the mechanisms in the G1/S restriction point were responsible for 95% of the sensitivity, conversely, the G2-DNA damage checkpoint showed a much stronger dependence on a few mechanisms; approximately 32% or 13 of 40 mechanisms accounted for 95% of the sensitivity. Our analysis predicted that CDC25 and cyclin E mechanisms were strongly implicated in G1/S malfunctions, while fragility in the G2/M checkpoint was predicted to be associated with the regulation of the cyclin B-CDK1 complex. Analysis of a third model containing both G1/S and G2/M checkpoint logic, predicted in addition to mechanisms already mentioned, that translation and programmed proteolysis were also key fragile subsystems. Comparison of the predicted fragile mechanisms with literature and current preclinical and clinical trials suggested a strong correlation between efficacy and fragility. Thus, when taken together, these results support the working hypothesis that cell-cycle control architectures are HOT networks and establish the mathematical estimation and subsequent therapeutic exploitation of fragile mechanisms as a novel strategy for anti-cancer lead generation.},

@article{Rice:2016aa,
	Abstract = {BACKGROUND: Thrombin generation (TG) is a pivotal process in achieving hemostasis. Coagulation profiles during pregnancy and early neonatal period are different from that of normal (non-pregnant) adults. In this ex vivo study, the differences in TG in maternal and cord plasma relative to normal adult plasma were studied.
METHODS: Twenty consented pregnant women and ten consented healthy adults were included in the study. Maternal and cord blood samples were collected at the time of delivery. Platelet-poor plasma was isolated for the measurement of TG. In some samples, anti-FIXa aptamer, RB006, or a TFPI inhibitor, BAX499 were added to elucidate the contribution of intrinsic and extrinsic pathway to TG. Additionally, procoagulant and inhibitor levels were measured in maternal and cord plasma, and these values were used to mathematically simulate TG.
RESULTS: Peak TG was increased in maternal plasma (393.6$\pm$57.9 nM) compared to adult and cord samples (323.2$\pm$38.9 nM and 209.9$\pm$29.5 nM, respectively). Inhibitory effects of RB006 on TG were less robust in maternal or cord plasma (52% vs. 12% respectively) than in adult plasma (81%). Likewise the effectiveness of BAX499 as represented by the increase in peak TG was much greater in adult (21%) than in maternal (10%) or cord plasma (12%). Further, BAX499 was more effective in reversing RB006 in adult plasma than in maternal or cord plasma. Ex vivo data were reproducible with the results of the mathematical simulation of TG.
CONCLUSION: Normal parturient plasma shows a large intrinsic pathway reserve for TG compared to adult and cord plasma, while TG in cord plasma is sustained by extrinsic pathway, and low levels of TFPI and AT.},

@article{pr3010178,
	Abstract = {In this study, we present a novel modeling approach which combines ordinary differential equation (ODE) modeling with logical rules to simulate an archetype biochemical network, the human coagulation cascade. The model consisted of five differential equations augmented with several logical rules describing regulatory connections between model components, and unmodeled interactions in the network. This formulation was more than an order of magnitude smaller than current coagulation models, because many of the mechanistic details of coagulation were encoded as logical rules. We estimated an ensemble of likely model parameters (N = 20) from in vitro extrinsic coagulation data sets, with and without inhibitors, by minimizing the residual between model simulations and experimental measurements using particle swarm optimization (PSO). Each parameter set in our ensemble corresponded to a unique particle in the PSO. We then validated the model ensemble using thrombin data sets that were not used during training. The ensemble predicted thrombin trajectories for conditions not used for model training, including thrombin generation for normal and hemophilic coagulation in the presence of platelets (a significant unmodeled component). We then used flux analysis to understand how the network operated in a variety of conditions, and global sensitivity analysis to identify which parameters controlled the performance of the network. Taken together, the hybrid approach produced a surprisingly predictive model given its small size, suggesting the proposed framework could also be used to dynamically model other biochemical networks, including intracellular metabolic networks, gene expression programs or potentially even cell free metabolic systems.},
